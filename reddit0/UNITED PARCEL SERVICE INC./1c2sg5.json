Potential for longer commutes, if you can sleep or get some work done while commuting it is viable to travel to work farther\n7. More in car dining\n\n\n\nWhat there will be less of:\n\n1. Taxis\n2. Highway Patrol\n3. Mass transit like trains and buses\n4. Delivery services, USPS\n5. School buses\n6. Short plane flights",
