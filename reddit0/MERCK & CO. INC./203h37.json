  "selftext": "I posted here three days earlier, feeling anxious about the health risks of the Gardasil vaccine I had received that day. Today I woke up and found the injection site on my left upper arm was sore again, and I had a hard, painful lump in my armpit with a sensation of tenderness along my left side.\n\nI followed the instructions on Merck & Co., Inc's website for this type of \"adverse reaction\" and called my doctor. I'm going to see her tomorrow morning. I'm not going to say that vaccinations aren't an important part of health, but I now seriously doubt that the Gardasil vaccine is right for me, I don't think I should receive the other two shots.\n\nI still want to thank the members who commented on my first post because they did put my mind at ease when I was feeling worried (no sarcasm).",
