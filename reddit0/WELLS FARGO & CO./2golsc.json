Only looking to keep in $1000-$2000 at any given time so it doesn't have to be anything special. \n\nI'm so done with Wells Fargo, we have tried multiple times to do this at the bank only for them to tell either my wife or I have an \"invalid account\" and it's \"out of date\" so they want to mess with all of our stuff... Additionally, they are trying to sell me on Credit Cards, investments and everything that is not a checking account. Not interested in all that, just a joint checking!!!! Anyways, I don't think I want to go with Bank of America either.... Looking for another local option...Any suggestions?? Thank you so much!",
