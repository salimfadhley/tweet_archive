My opinion is if some of these issues were cleaned up, she would be a much better feeling character.</p>\n\n<p>I do have videos of these and will try to find the time stamps tomorrow but I want to get this post out to get opinions over whether or not some of these should be kept or removed. </p>\n\n<p>A) Freia&#39;s dash causes her to be oddly immune to Ashabel&#39;s knockback.  This immunity either lasts a second after the dash lands or until she can move after the dash. I can&#39;t tell which. I feel like this should be changed since Ashabel at least should be able to force Freia to dash twice since Freia has a method of getting past this bit of counter play.</p>\n\n<p>B) Certain forms of CC and death stop Ashabel&#39;s q mid projectile. After Ashabel&#39;s q is launched(cast animation ends and she can move again) if she gets flipped by Cerulean or dies, the q lands but deals no damage. This makes it so she can&#39;t try to trade kills if she is going to die since her abilities have travel times. I don&#39;t feel that after the q is cast it should disappear. Personal opinion since things like Zalgus&#39;s e don&#39;t(least I remember people dying to it after he died). I counted 5 kills I lost because of this in total in the short time I was playing her. </p>\n\n<p>C) This is mentioned in another post so I&#39;ll keep it short. Ashabel being unable to knock Mina away during the travel time on fear. This makes Mina damn near impossible to deal with without a summoner on Ashabel.</p>\n\n<p>D) Fix z axis interactions since her primary damage is ground targeted and pairing Ashabel with characters like Desecrator can really screw with you. Desecrator&#39;s knockup makes all of Ashabel&#39;s moves miss on knocked up characters. I know this is a known problem, but I&#39;m just adding it for the sake of addressing it. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
