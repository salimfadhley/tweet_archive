The ban I recieved the 25th and the ban I recieved today (Dec. 3rd) are for the exact same post.\n\nAlso, I dont really have anything against european countries. Ive been to paris once and Rome once. Spent 2 weeks in each city and loved it. The post was more out of boredom and some trolling. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember me? The man with the mustache that was banned for 72 hours from battlelog for saying germany is badass. Well apparently a moderator dug the topic up again and banned me for it  A SECOND TIME. I was already banned for the topic I made, so why am I being banned again for it?\n\nAnd now again, I am completely unable to access battlelog and play the game.\n\nHere is my previous topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/mptco/i_was_banned_from_battlelog_for_72_hours_for/\n\nBelieve this shit.\n\nHello ,\n \nYour Electronic Arts account has been suspended for 72 hours for violating the Terms of Services for Electronic Arts Online.\n \nViolation:\n \nInappropriate language:\nPost:Romania: good place to live if you wanna starve to death Finland: they play lots of tennis i hear Portugal: good food apparently Denmark: almost as badass as germany.

The advisor ended the chat without warning:\n\nyou: Hello Ashok.\n\nAshok: Thanks for contacting EA Help! My name is Ashok how may I help you?\n\nyou: I have a frustrating and strange problem here. Allow me to explain.\n\nAshok: Please take your time.\n\nyou: I was temporarily banned November 25th for 72 hours forinappropriate language. I served my ban and was unbanned November 28th.\n\nyou: THis ban was due to a battlelog forum post I had made.\n\nThe chat session has ended. Please contact us again if you need further help.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nEDIT: MY SECOND ATTEMPT AT AN EA ADVISOR CHAT. Little more helpful, but obviously reading from a script. \n\nyou: hello Aditi.\n \nAditi: Thank you for contacting EA Help. My name is $!{Aditi}. How may I assist you today?\n \nyou: I have a frustrating and strange problem here. Allow me to explain.\n \nAditi: Sure, please tell me.\n \nyou: I was temporarily banned November 25th for 72 hours forinappropriate language. I served my ban and was unbanned November 28th. THis ban was due to a battlelog forum post I had made on battlelog. Just now I recieved an email from EA that I have been suspended for another further 72 hours for the exact same\n \nyou: post I was banned for the first time.\n \nyou: I have 2 bans now for the same post.\n \nAditi: I can see that you are upset. \n \nyou: Why was I banned twice for the same post?\n \nyou: I did not re-post the post that got me in trouble november 25th.\n \nyou: A mod went back and banned me a second time for the same thing I was already banned for once.\n \nyou: ************ is my email if you can look into it please.\n \nAditi: Could you give me just a couple of minutes while I try to get this processed. \n \nyou: Thank you.\n \nAditi: The pleasure is entirely mine. \n \nAditi: You're not allowed to access all the games for 72 hours.\n \nyou: Im aware of that.\n \nyou: Why was I banned twice for the same post?\n \nAditi: I can see your account was banned for inappropriate language. \n \nyou: You EA advisors are like robots reading from a script. I'll try another advisor thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nEDIT: MY THIRD ATTEMPT AT AN EA ADVISOR CHAT. Another robot:\n\nyou: hello Mahendra\n \nMahendra: Thanks for contacting EA Help! My name is Mahendra how may I help you?\n \nMahendra: Hello\n \nyou: I have a frustrating and strange problem here. Allow me to explain.\n \nyou: I was temporarily banned November 25th for 72 hours forinappropriate language. I served my ban and was unbanned November 28th. THis ban was due to a battlelog forum post I had made on battlelog.\n \nyou: Just now I recieved an email from EA that I have been suspended for another further 72 hours for the exact same post I was banned for the first time.\n \nyou: I have 2 bans now for the same post.\n \nMahendra: Roger, Due to your wrong activities in game forum, EA has banned your account to be used.\n\nI'm afraid but EA bans account after proper investigation which cannot be overturned.\n\nIf you think you are right at your place then kindly mail us on customerservice@ea.com.\n \n \nyou: I can see that.\n\nyou: Another robot. Thanks.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nMY FOURTH ATTEMPT AT AN EA ADVISOR CHAT. He seemed genuinely interested in helping, but likely the problem is above his capabilities:\n\nGaurav : Thanks for contacting EA Help! My name is Gaurav  how may I help you?\n \nyou: I would like to speak to a tier 2 advisor please if thats possible.\n \nyou: My problem is likely above your capabilities.\n \nyou: Its regardining an unfair ban.\n \nGaurav : May I know which problem you are facing actually?\n \nyou: I was banned twice for the same forum post. Basically punished twice for the same crime.\n \nyou: I didnt re-post the original post I was banned for.\n \nyou: I was actually banned a second time for the same post.\n \nyou: 2 72 hour bans for the same post, and the bans are 7 days apart.\n \nyou: Strange a moderator went back to the post a second time and banned me for it again.\n \nyou: I just need to speak to someone of a higher tier.\n \nGaurav : May I have your e-mail please?\n \nyou: ***********\n \nyou: As you can see if you check my ban history. Both bans are for the exact same forum post. lol\n \nGaurav : I would need some time to investigate this, please stay connected. \n \nyou: Of course.\n \nGaurav : I have checked and found that your account is suspended for 72 hours.\n \nyou: Yes I am aware of that.\n \nyou: But Im suspended for something I was already suspended for before.\n \nGaurav : This is not the concern department for who looks upon this issue.\n \nyou: Who can I speak too about it?\n \nGaurav : I will forward your issue to concern department they will look into issue.\n \nyou: Thank you.\n \nyou: I just dont understand how I could be banned twice for the exact same offense.\n \nGaurav : You are welcome.\n \nyou: Have a nice day\n\n--------------------------------------\nEDIT: I JUST EMAILED EA'S SUPPORT. Waiting for an email back. Here is a copy of the email I sent:\n\nI was suspended for 72 hours from battlelog on November 25th for an offensive forum post I made. I served my suspension and was unsuspended on the 28th. Now on December 3rd, I recieve another email from EA, informing me I have been suspended yet again for another 72 hours for the exact same forum post I was suspended for the first time.\n\nI did not re-post the original post I was suspended for. A moderator dug up the post and suspended me for it a second time. I see this as a case of \"double jeopardy\", in which I have been punished for the same crime more than once.\n\nI am sure this was just an error and the moderator that suspended me the second time was unaware that I had been suspended for the post already 8 days earlier.\n\nThank you.\n\n------------------------------------\nEDIT: EA'S RESPONSE TO MY EMAIL. Again telling me what I already know:\n\nHello Roger,\n \nPlease note that your account \"*email here*\" has been suspended for 72 hours on \"2011-12-03\" at \"21:15:44\" for violating the Terms of Services for Electronic Arts Online.\n \nAccount Violation -: For inappropriate language.\n \nPlease read the Terms of Service for Electronic Arts Online by visiting the below mentioned link : \n\"http://legal.ea.com/legal/legal.jsp?language=en\"\n \nIf you have any further questions please reply to this email or visit our extensive knowledge base online at \"http://help.ea.com\"\n \n\nThanks & Regards,\nKhalid Hashmi,\nElectronic Arts -World Wide Customer experience.\n \n\nref:00DEIO80.500E1Nvba:ref\n\n\n\n \n",
