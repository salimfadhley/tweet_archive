The early Tekkit series was great with the rival companies of Honeydew Inc. and Sipsco with so many great moments of their antics against each other.  I love the Blackrock series with some of the best moments involving the conflict between Rythian and Sjin/Duncan.  It also gave more opportunity to cross groups (i.e. Sjin showing up in Rythian's series)  But now there seems to be no conflict at all.  Again, I greatly enjoy watching what's been going on, seeing Duncan build crazy science stuff really encourages me to build more stuff like that on my server and Sjin's farming series is quite relaxing and almost like a Let's Build that he's playing at the same time.  I'm hoping that they have something planned at some point, but I was curious what everyone else thought about conflict in the series to have some sort of loose plot.",
