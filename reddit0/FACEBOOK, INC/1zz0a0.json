The page that's located at \"https://www.facebook.com/MysteryScienceTheater3K\" and using \"MST3K\" as it's landing page on a Facebook is not anything officially connected with the show or its former stars.

He was recently reprimanded by Joel when he to use the Gizmonics brand to sell a line of t-shirts and hoodies.  He was also forced by Facebook to stop representing himself as an official page for the show, and change much of the language on his about page.  He also provides \"helpful links\" to box sets on Amazon to collect reseller revenue when you use his links, robbing money from official channels that depend on that income to continue their operation.\n\nScrew that guy.\n\nInstead, get your official information from:\n\n* http://www.mst3k.com (Best Brains Inc's official website)\n* http://www.mst3kinfo.com (Best Brains Inc's officially approved fansite) \n* https://www.facebook.com/mst3kinfo (Best Brains Inc's officially approved fansite's Facebook page) \n* https://www.facebook.com/mysterysciencetheater3000 (ShoutFactory's official Facebook page for the show)",
