What are the groups thought on such a scheme and on the future of Unilever PLC? It seems to be a straight forward basic return on 11% on investment (discounting the share price which may go up or down) which post tax implication will be 7.5%. Do you think the investment is worth it or there are better avenues for investing this money (Roughly 15K a month)  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
