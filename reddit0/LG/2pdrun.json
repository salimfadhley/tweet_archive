  "selftext": "Hey all, Looking for a place to put this and I've seen some discussion on this sub about 4k TVs so I thought you all might want to know about this. \n\nI've gone through the process of researching and purchasing a 4K TV recently and I have an issue with product in terms of what was advertised vs. reality. \n\nI bought the LG 55UB8500 UHD 4KTV off of Amazon for $1299.00 (the price has since risen to $1399.00, you can see the link [here](http://smile.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-55UB8500-55-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00II6VY6C/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1418657982&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=55UB8500&sa-no-redirect=1). Most notably, the images on Amazon show a TV with a very thin bezel approx. 2-3mm thick left, right and top. However, when the TV came, it had a much wider bezel of 10mm thick left, right and top. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/urlYDEA.jpg). Even the box it came it was slapped with the same \"bezeless\" [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/FLwqcXe.jpg) from the promotional material.\n\nNow, I've called both LG customer service and Amazon technical help about this issue. \n\nFor LG, pretty much everyone I talked to had no idea what a bezel even was, and when finally they understood, they looked at their own spec sheet and said that the bezel of this unit is spec'd at 10mm thick. Low and behold, when asked to locate that information on their website, everyone said that it was not listed. \n\nFor Amazon, they at least sort-of knew what was going on and told me that yes, I was correct, and the visual material were not consistent with the delivered product. The only thing they could do about it was return the TV. They also say that they've flagged the page as needing an update. \n\nI have two theories about this discrepancy:\n\n1. LG actually did a production run of the unit as shown with the bezel super thin and the coinciding promotional materials at the MSRP of $2,299.00 (listed on their website). Then, to drop the price drastically for sales etc. they did a second production run with the cheaper, thicker bezel, but neglected to change the promotional materials. \n\n2. A not so smart graphic designer took the promotional shots of the TV in its off state [seen here](http://imgur.com/a/NoNfr) and photoshopped the homepage content into them without the pertinent info on the bezel size. \n\nOther than this surprise, the TV overall is fantastic. Picture looks great, resolution is as promised, blacks look very good and off axis is very good in a dark room setting (glare from a window or light can make the off axis impossible to see).\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue or if they have any advice. But first and foremost I want to let people know about this since there doesn't seem to be adequate information online about it. \n\nThanks a lot, if you have questions, I'll answer them as best as possible.  \n\n\n\n**EDIT: So it seems like this is getting a little bit of attention so I'd thought I'd clarify a few questions overall:\n\n1. I am currently able to get a full refund for the TV and have it returned to the Amazon seller free of cost. The questions for myself is whether to keep the TV as is, or go to a retail store to look for a replacement in my price range.\n2. I have yet to find out if any products in this LG line were made with the extremely small bezel that they show. If anyone has any pictures or evidence, please post them or PM me. \n3. I am not rich. I do fine, and prioritize my spending. One of my priorities is having a top quality display in my living room, especially since I work in entertainment. I'm not really sure what this questions has to do with the original post, but a lot of people are asking so here I am.\n\nI've been working today so I apologize if I've been slow responding to questions. Thanks for everyone's help and suggestions.  \n\n",
