We were originally supposed to go from Dublin to London, then on to LA where we&#39;d spend two days seeing some sights then head on to Austin, Texas. Our flight from Dublin to London was delayed and we ended up missing our connection. After standing in line in London for about 6 or 7 hours we were put on a flight to Paris leaving the next day and then went on to LA. Our bags were never returned to us and we were told we&#39;d get them in LA. When we arrived in LA we were told they were missing. With the delay we then ended up having to fly out to Austin (our final destination) a few hours later and couldn&#39;t do much about it. Finally after 4 days in Austin our bags were finally found and sent to Austin airport. </p>\n\n<p>When we arrived to collect them we noticed there was a huge hole in the side of one of them, the one which held our camera equipment. We checked it immediately but everything was gone. The guys at the baggage desk told us it was most likely the TSA who were responsible. We&#39;ve tried contacting the airlines, but so far we are just being bounced around by all of them because of all of the different airlines we flew with because of all the connections we were on (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and United, plus American Airlines who delivered the bags). We&#39;re also trying to get in touch with our insurance company in Ireland but we haven&#39;t had any luck with that yet. Even if they do let us make a claim theres no way they&#39;ll come close to covering the replacement costs. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest problem though is that we are in the U.S on 1 year work visas which require us to get a job asap. Every day without our equipment is a day we can&#39;t work. We can&#39;t afford to replace it and we just don&#39;t know what to do. </p>\n\n<p>Is there anything we can do to make this process go faster? Do we have any chance of recovering our stuff? Has anyone else been through this and can offer some advice? Do any redditors who work in the airline industry or with the TSA have any suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas or suggestions at all would be a huge help.
