I imagine this is the conversation they had with themselves. /angryIcannotchangemysparkplugsforshitssake.\n\nBMW: What is that?\n\nCommon Sense: Oh.. that's a standard sized spark plug socket. Used on most cars to remove the spark plugs.\n\nBMW: So you're telling me most cars use one or two different spark plug sockets?\n\n\nCommon Sense: Yup! Makes it pretty easy for everyone to do basic maintenance on their vehicles.\n\nBMW: We.... we're gonna make ours different.\n\nCommon Sense: Uhh... why would you do that?\n\nBMW: Well because normal spark plugs are normal and we don't like that. So ours will be 14MM with splines instead of a normal hex. It will require a special tool to remove it because the holes will be so narrow that the socket you find has to be specifically made for the engine because we did that so it's different\n\nCommon Sense: Wait that doesn't make any sense at all.. What the hell are you talking about?\n\nBMW: WIR UNTERNEHMEN UNSERE anders und es nichts, was man dagegen tun. SIE die richtige Buchse KAUFEN UND SEIEN SIE ERHALTEN AUF DER Auto zur Arbeit. Nichts anderes von Bedeutung.\n\nCommon Sense: Wait wait I don't speak German..\n\nBMW: YES. THANK YOU.\n",
