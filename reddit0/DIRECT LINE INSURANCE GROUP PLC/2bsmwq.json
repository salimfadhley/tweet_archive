I am having less migrajnes thanks to topomax, but my insomnia isnt helping and no one will do shit about my sleep.  Melatonin 10mg and benadryl 100mg isnt working anymore.  The past 2 nights I have gotten 0 sleep the first night triggering the migrajne the second night worsenjng it.  My neuro says he wont perscribe any pajn relief.  My primary wont either.  I have no idea what to do.  And no one will even listen to the dact that I get maybe 1-2 hours of sleep at night causing this migraine to reoccur.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I dont think my insurance covers headache clinics or pain clinics.  I called my doctors direct line but im not expecting a call back.",
