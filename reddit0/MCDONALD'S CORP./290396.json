  "selftext": "For those of you who read [this post today](http://www.reddit.com/r/perktv/comments/28xhtn/regarding_the_thoughtless_twit_that_got_flagged/, or even read [the original one](http://www.reddit.com/r/perktv/comments/28xadi/trouble_cashing_out_gcs_at_walmart_california/), this might be of interest to you. \n\n**TLDR: You have the right to cash out gift cards in CA as long as it is under $10.**\n\nAfter reading those posts, I thought I'd do a little digging to see whether it is against the law to do what that person was doing (redeeming dozens of $5 GCs at once), or for Walmart to reject his request. Well, there was actually a court case that dealt with nearly this exact circumstance.\n\n[Marilao v. McDonald's Corp.](http://classactiondefense.jmbm.com/mcdonalds_class_action_defense_sdc2_ord.pdf) was a 2009 case where Marilao requested cash for a gift card that was given to him. His first court case was denied because he did not state that it was below $10. After he amended his class action complaint to clarify that the GC was below $10, he won his case on 2 bases:\n\n>> 1. \u201cA plaintiff suffers an injury in fact for purposes of standing under the UCL when he or she has: ... (3) been denied money to which he or she has a cognizable claim [citations omitted].\u201d\n>> 2. \"Plaintiff sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unjust enrichment\"\n\nBecause he was denied cash for his gift card, he was 'denied money to which he or she has a cognizable claim'. As well, because McDonalds is paid for GCs, if they deny a customer's request for a cashout of less than $10, they are committing unjust enrichment.\n\nI looked up the [California Law that related to gift cards](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&group=01001-02000&file=1749.45-1749.6) and it states this about rewards programs:\n\n>This section does not apply to any of the following gift\ncertificates issued on or after January 1, 1998, provided the expiration date appears in capital letters in at least 10-point font on the front of the gift certificate:\n   (1) Gift certificates that are distributed by the issuer to a consumer pursuant to an awards, loyalty, or promotional program without any money or other thing of value being given in exchange for the gift certificate by the consumer.\n\nI feel like Walmart could use this statement to argue that Perk Walmart GCs don't have to be turned into cash, although it can be argued that viewing videos is the exchange of value. My suggestion is to purchase plastic GCs in the store using the Perk GCs (I do this all the time to consolidate multiple paper GCs into a single plastic one), then take the plastic GCs to get redeemed for cash.\n\nAs for a Walmart policy limiting redemptions to 1-3 per day, CA Civil Code 1749.51 states:\n\n> Any waiver of the provisions of this title is contrary to\npublic policy, and is void and unenforceable.\n\nIf they say that they will only do a limited number per day and deny your request, it is contrary to 1749.5(2(b)), and their policy is void. \n\nIf you are denied the cash-out option for GCs less than $10, I recommend the following options:\n\n1. Ask to speak to the manager. Calmly explain the law to them. Have either an electronic copy of the law handy, or more preferably, a printed copy so they can read it easier.\n\n2. If that fails, write the retailer to notify them of the law and ask to comply with it. \n\n3. File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.\n\nGood luck to those of you lucky enough to have this law apply to them.\n",
