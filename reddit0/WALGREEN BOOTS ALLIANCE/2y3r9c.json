I have over $43k worth of stocks on TD Ameritrade that I'd be interested in moving over to Vanguard (in addition to what you currently see here). What would you recommend I do with my brokerage account? I've been told to cut back on VFINX because it overlaps with VTTSX. I would be interested to hear what you guys think.
