  "selftext": "Since I know the opinion of Gawker sites on reddit (even though I think Jalop is an exception to the shit Gawker produces) I've copy & pasted the article here. If you decide you want to give a Gawker site traffic (or see pictures of LMP1) cars, here's a link to article: http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/audis-le-mans-chief-says-f1-is-not-even-comparable-to-w-1730648495?rev=1442343359602\n\nArticle text:\n\nWith Porsche\u2019s World Endurance Championship team looking so good at Le Mans and the N\u00fcrburgring, everybody\u2019s wondering: what are the other LMP1 teams doing to match that pace? We asked Audi Sport Head of LMP Chris Reinke at the WEC\u2019s last round at the N\u00fcrburgring to find out. \n\nAfter the 6 Hours of the N\u00fcrburgring, Audi sits 33 points behind Porsche in the WEC manufacturers\u2019 championship, but it ain\u2019t over yet.\n\nAnd besides chasing Porsche for a hopeful title win, Audi is still dogged by the rumor that they could head to Formula One. Does getting back on top in the WEC still even matter for the historically dominant Audi team? Having two Volkswagen Group brands in the same top-level motorsport, Audi\u2019s hiring of ex-Ferrari F1 team principal Stefano Domenicali, and Audi\u2019s defensive denials make it sound as if an Audi F1 team could be a real possibility.\n\nReinke made it clear: Audi\u2019s heart is with this Le Mans prototype, and he\u2019s very passionate about keeping the LMP1 program around for a good, long while. \n\n\u201cIf you look at our success in LMP1, [F1] wouldn\u2019t be a step up,\u201d Reinke said.\n\nReinke explained that Audi identifies itself with the height of technology, and that\u2019s happening in sports cars \u2014 not the highly restricted world of Formula One. \n\n\u201cFor me, they\u2019re so far apart, they\u2019re not even comparable,\u201d explained Reinke. \u201cThis is about creating technology that\u2019s road relevant.\n\nThe things Audi is allowed to experiment with in WEC \u2014 hybrid systems, diesel fuel, all-wheel drive \u2014 are things that fit directly with what the company does on the road car side, and if Reinke has anything to say about it, that\u2019s where they\u2019ll stay. \n\n\u201cWe want to prove our engineering against other manufacturers here at the WEC,\u201d explained Reinke.\n\nAs far as closing the gap with Porsche this year goes, Reinke said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason that Audi is always the subject of Formula One rumors is just how insanely unbeatable the team has been in the past. Their LMP1 team, Audi Sport Team Joest, has won Le Mans 13 times, second only to fellow Volkswagen Group brand and chief rival Porsche. They\u2019ve been WEC manufacturers\u2019 champions for the first two years of the WEC\u2019s three-year existence. \n\nNow they\u2019re in the unusual position of having to play catch-up.\n\nOne of Porsche\u2019s wins this year was Le Mans, which is a double points race in the WEC. Porsche ended a five-year winning streak for Audi after the Audi team made some uncharacteristic mistakes during the race. Audi, however, had strong wins at Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps earlier in the season.\n\nIt\u2019s these two teams who will definitely be fighting for the 2015 season championship as 2014 manufacturer\u2019s champions Toyota lag 95 points behind Porsche and are already directing most of their efforts towards an all-new car for 2016. Meanwhile, Nissan has pulled out until they are satisfied with their radically different car\u2019s performance. \n\nThe N\u00fcrburgring race was important because all three LMP1 teams could claim it as a home race \u2014 even Toyota, who races as a Japanese entry, but whose LMP1 operations are out of nearby Cologne. The N\u00fcrburgring is a place that lives and breathes motorsport on a normal day, and Audi themselves brought 150 Audi Sport employees who normally wouldn\u2019t travel with the team from their base of operations in Ingolstadt to watch the race.\n\nThe N\u00fcrburgring also marked an important point in the WEC season: halfway. (Or over halfway if we\u2019re going by hours of race time!) Four races are down, and four remain: Austin, Fuji, Shanghai and Bahrain. These next few races will be crucial in determining if Audi and Porsche will stay neck and neck with each other, or if one clear victor will emerge.\n\nOne of those races is this weekend: the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, in Austin. \n\nFor Reinke, who \u2014 despite his accent \u2014 was actually born in Evanston, Ill., Austin is also the closest thing the WEC has to a home race for him. What\u2019s interesting about many of the World Endurance Championship teams is just how international they really are. English seems to be the common language that most teams use, but teams\u2019 talent comes from all over, including the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A.\n\nAudi in particular is looking for success in the United States. It\u2019s a growing market for them, and despite having customer programs all over, their only major works program that races in the United States is the LMP1.\n\nThe WEC as a whole is growing as well. While the Audi team was sad to see many of the classic American events fall off their LMP1 calendar, LMP1 programs had essentially priced themselves out the merged Tudor United SportsCar series. Audi still loves to test its LMP1 at Sebring (even if it\u2019s not at the 12 Hours of Sebring itself) because of the bumpy surface that Reinke says is \u201chell on everything\u201d there, but too few competitors were willing to compete at that level of investment in one continent\u2019s championship.\n\nThe WEC, though, has had success giving those big-budget programs a place to flourish. Reinke credits the public\u2019s fascination with technology for the series\u2019 growth. \n\nAs for what specifically Audi is doing with the car itself to catch up in the WEC series championship, details are (for obvious reasons) rather sparse. The major components of the car are basically set for 2015. Audi confirms their package for the season, and might change around minor items like brake ducts and winglets, but the package as a whole stays relatively stable all season long. \n\nOne major factor in the performance of the Audi LMP1 this year is the fact that Audi\u2019s R18 e-tron quattro runs a much smaller hybrid system than Porsche\u2019s 919 Hybrid \u2014 4 megajoules compared to the 919\u2019s 8 megajoules. It\u2019s a trade-off: big hybrid systems give the car a lot of extra boost, but they also weigh a ton. Reinke says that this year\u2019s R18 works best on flowing tracks.\n\nAt this point in the season, however, Reinke said, \u201cOur resources for development are on next year\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nAudi is in the early phase of development for its 2016 car, currently testing out different ideas on different simulation tools. The 2016 Audi LMP1 will be confirmed at the end of the year, and Audi hopes it brings them not only a season championship, but another win at Le Mans. \n\nThey\u2019re not alone in starting this early on the 2016-spec car. Toyota, too, confirmed that they\u2019re right in the thick of putting their 2016 TS 050 together. \n\nSo we\u2019ll see if the updates they\u2019re developing will force the other teams to be the ones playing catch-up in series points after Le Mans next year. They\u2019re not going anywhere in the near future. \n\n\n\n",
