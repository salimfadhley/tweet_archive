I have a strong love for economics as well as a solid grasp and understanding of its core concepts but I&#39;m not a professional.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, with all the drama about the trade restrictions, marketing restrictions, and gifting restrictions, based on the upvotes on various comments, it has come to my attention that many people in this subreddit are ignorant/uninformed about economics(or why valve is doing what it&#39;s doing from a logical/rational perspective). Many people seem to think the whole issue revolves around credit card fraud....It&#39;s not. Period. I&#39;ll explain why later. But first and foremost, I&#39;ll explain, from an economist to be&#39;s point of view, why valve is doing what it&#39;s doing.</p>\n\n<p>First, to get a good understanding of the current situation, this post gives a pretty solid summary of the whole market history <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3ok2um/an_indeph_post_about_dota_trading_and_market/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3ok2um/an_indeph_post_about_dota_trading_and_market/</a> (minus all the sentiment ofc). To sum it up, with the ever growing player base, valve is losing a lot of potential profits due to the market becoming a near perfect substitute to its store at far lower prices. So what can be done about this situation? </p>\n\n<p>As a logical business, it&#39;s simple: Eliminate(or at least reduce) arbitrage and use Second Degree Price discrimination. To put it in layman&#39;s terms, arbitrage is simply the ability to resell (for a profit). With the various restrictions added, reselling(or trading), becomes a lot more of a pain in the ass thus reducing the effectiveness of the store&#39;s substitutes. Furthermore, with much less arbitrage, it allows for second degree price discrimination. What is it? Well, lets start with the fact that in general, to maximize profits, you ideally want to offer a higher price to people who are willing to pay more and a lower price to people who are willing to pay less in order to grab all the consumer surplus. Make sense? Now lets introduce another term, elasticity, which basically in this context means price sensitivity. People with low elasticities are insensitive to prices, meaning that the amount they consume doesn&#39;t change much w. &quot;X&quot; increase in price. Similarly, people with high elasticities are very sensitive to prices, meaning that they consume a lot less w. &quot;X&quot; increase in price. The problem is, you can&#39;t tell; there&#39;s no incentive (in fact there&#39;s disincentive) for the consumer to signal to the producer his/her elasticity, so what do you do here?</p>\n\n<p>Well that&#39;s the beauty of 2nd degree price discrimination. It sets an artificial barrier (in this case the time of 3 months) so that seperates the high elasticities and the low elasticities. The people who are price insensitive wouldn&#39;t care about the higher price in the store and buy it asap during the hype whereas the people who REALLY hate the price increase and aren&#39;t THAT into the set would wait 3 months to buy the set. Take a moment to think about that; as much of a pain in the ass this is to us, can you appreciate how smart that is? During the period of hype, people 1 year ago who were willing to pay 10$ could rebuy it on the market for say 3$ (just example numbers), getting consumer surplus (which was potential profit for valve). Now they have to pay their max willingness to pay, assuming valve prices their items in store smart, and valve captures all that surplus as profit. The people with high elasticties (poor, don&#39;t care about hype,etc) have their surplus captured too, just 3 months later. This way, valve can maximize their profits.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure many people think this is cynical, maybe some of you think this is just a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;(these would be the same mouth breathers who think the moon landing was staged). However, to me this is simply rational, and assuming that valve is a firm that wants to maximize its profits and considering they have tons of better economists than me who are capable of making these rational decisions, I strongly believe that this is a strong part of the reasoning behind their decision.</p>\n\n<p>So why isn&#39;t this due to Credit Card Fraud like the PR guy from valve said? They&#39;d tell us if they were trying to maximize their profits from us right? /s Just look at CS:GO. Their items have a 1 week TRADE restriction and are immediately marketable since their economy isn&#39;t in the fucked up situation the dota 2 one is in from utter oversupply and disincentive to buy/open up chests. And to all the people who think that it&#39;s because of a &quot;pay barrier&quot; in CS:GO, stop spewing out shit you don&#39;t understand. All store items can be bought WITHOUT owning the game. There&#39;s a link on the browser to various items in various quantities that you can find on <a href=\"/r/globaloffensivetrade\">r/globaloffensivetrade</a>. You can ALSO sell, trade, and buy items on the market WITHOUT owning the game (source: I traded 100+ keys and a m4a1-s knight all w.o having cs:go). So no, apart from the 1 week restriction, all the additional bullshit/restrictions isn&#39;t due to &quot;credit card fraud&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Looking through posts, many people also mentioned that Valve wouldn&#39;t intentionally piss us off as bad pr= loss of revenue right? That&#39;s true to an extent. To me, all this means is that revenue lost from bad PR is less than revenue gained from setting these restrictions. So what&#39;s the best way to stop these restrictions? Make it s that revenue lost &gt; revenue gained...easier said than done though...in fact that&#39;s pretty unrealistic all things considering.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s pretty much it. In the end, I don&#39;t have a realistic solution to combat this. A &quot;boycott&quot; is stupid, even if we were somehow able to reach out to the 99% not on reddit and convince them, game theory alone will make sure this fails. We&#39;re pretty much stuck in this shit situation. But hopefully, I&#39;ve educated some of the naive souls who to this day think that Valve is &quot;acting in our best interests&quot; and all of this is caused by &quot;those few scammers ruining it for everyone&quot;. This is a result of valve mishandling their economy and driving it to a miserable point, where many items valued at 2.5$ + in their store instantly became a 50 cents on the market. Now they&#39;re trying to pick up the pieces and we&#39;re on the receiving end.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: TL;DR The reason valve is doing these restrictions isn&#39;t because &quot;credit card fraud&quot;, it&#39;s because of profit maximization explained via economic theory.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I&#39;ve been getting a lot of feedback about how condescending the post is and I agree. My apologies, but my writing is naturally obnoxious/assholely and it&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to work on. Despite what people might think, I didn&#39;t post my education to &quot;brag about my extensive knowledge&quot; but to show that I have a good basis of understand on what i&#39;m talking about but also to show that my word shouldn&#39;t be taken as law as I&#39;m not an expert in the field. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: People are asking about the chest that&#39;s permanently untradable. Here&#39;s my theory/explanation for that:\n I believe the reason those new chests aren&#39;t tradable is an &quot;item sink&quot;. With their fuck ups of overmassing rares to the point where they&#39;re 3 cents each, they need to get rid of excess supply. But they can&#39;t just delete them outright, people would be really pissed. So what do they do? Make a chest (where people recycle rares to get more of) that people want but make the items locked to the account; effectively deleting their items while giving them &quot;nothing of value&quot; but making them happy with their personal use sets. &quot;win-win&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: I really didn&#39;t mean to offend anyone....I just wanted to share economic theory; my intention REALLY wasn&#39;t to brag about how knowledgable I am.....why would anyone BRAG about being 2nd year in uni? I simply stated it to show that I have a some basis of knowledge when I&#39;m explaining things. So can you guys please stop w. the flame + personal attacks in pm, at least until after major qualifiers?</p>\n\n<p>Edit 5: 2 things, 1 i realize I worded arbitrage poorly but I think the message/idea behind it is still clear. 2. There&#39;s really no need to send me death threats or tell me to go kill myself.....like seriously lol. I just made this post because I enjoy economics and thought it would be cool to spread my interpretation/analysis with other people while debunking what I thought was a popular misconception. I get people think my writing is condescending but are you really mad enough to spam me telling me to kill myself?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
