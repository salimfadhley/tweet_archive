Neither do I, yet at the beginning of the movie Mike and Sully watch themselves in a TV commercial. What doesn&#39;t make sense is why the company would make the commercial, because it&#39;s obvious that everyone needs and uses their product and that their are no other scaring companies to obtain the energy. Another thought: isn&#39;t it weird how energy is such a big deal in the monster world?  But in Monsters Inc, Sulley is famous and very well-known in the monster world. And in Monsters University, Mike and Sulley discuss scare cards. Those are the monster version of our sports cards, but sports players never seemed to get any recognition in the monster world.
