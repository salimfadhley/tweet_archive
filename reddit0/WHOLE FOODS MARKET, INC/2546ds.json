The market is not closed join Sunday, however the produce stalls in the top sheds are replaced with touristy crap stalls, and the market is closed on a Sunday. So these stalls are extremely keen to offload their produce rather than pack it away for their two day closing. I regularly get bargains such as 10 kilos of tomatoes for $5, 10 kilo boxes of zucchinis for $5, huge trays of cherry tomatoes for $2 and so on.

It works out to be insanely cheap (like 6 months worth of strawberries for 50 cents a kilo cheap). You just need a couple of hours to process them, preferably on the day you buy the produce. </p>\n\n<p>Also, don&#39;t forget to ask for deals, and if any of you are dumpster divers, there is a HUGE amount of stuff thrown away!</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
