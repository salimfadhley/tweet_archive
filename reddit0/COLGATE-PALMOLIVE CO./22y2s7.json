( ie, does this belong in /r/dogecoinbeg, should I start a crowdfund page, **should I keep it to myself and not involve other people?**) I've made comments that my Pride is too great, but my humility has broken through.  This is an example of that.  I'm trying to reach out on Facebook, Craig's list, IRC, and now Reddit. \n\nI have been trying to avoid posting a thread in /r/dogecoin in hopes my family and I could reach our goal through my [Estate Liquidation Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/22eh7d/sg_liquidating_entire_family_estate/) alone, unfortunately the timing is poor due to profitability.  We have already received amazing support from many kind shibes however. \n\n**I am *NOT* begging for your money unrequited, because that is against the rules. But I would gladly accept some uplifting words, if you can spare a few.**\n\nI sent a message to the mods a few days ago, but have not received any response or guidance, so I apologize if I am offending a rule (I did review the Reddiquette and General Rules on the right-hand pane, and originally misunderstood the rule againt \"begging\", I have since edited it for compliance). \n\nI feel like I'm on the end of my rope, and oscillate from upbeat to panicked daily.  I'm not suicidal, but I do feel like I'm trapped. Unfortunately, I do not have the privilege/time to show this level of uncertainty in front of my children, or my wife. We're doing everything we can to keep each other strong, and sane. The fact of the matter is though, I just can't do enough to make it all work. I can't will myself to be strong or happy. I try, dog(e) knows I try, but it's like filling a bucket with a whole in the bottom.  I do my best to at least remain stoic, but my family can tell somethings eating me from the inside. \n\nFor the sake of brevity, I won't post the long story here, only ask that you visit the link above to get the complete story. \n\n\n**[The whole clan on a typical Saturday Morning]( http://i.imgur.com/KPTHS2t.jpg)**\n\n\n**TL:DR:**\nMy 4yr old stepson was sexually assaulted multiple times over the course of a year, the courts can not prosecute anyone because my son was/is too young to name the perpetrator(s), and is terrified. His biological father is attempting to remove him from the only family he has ever known (my children and I have been in his life since he was a year old, he calls me daddy, and my children \u201cbother and big siter\u201d), and is attempting to prevent us from taking him to therapy. We're trying to hire a Family Law attorney for him/us, since the courts will not assign him a Guardian Ad Litem because there's no disclosure and the District Attorney can't get involved. (We're going to try to push for the federal statute that states \u201cThe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires states to appoint guardians ad litem for children in abuse or neglect proceedings. 42 U.S.C. 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii). See Francine M. Neilson v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 199 f.3d 642 (2d Cir. 1999)\u201d.\n\n But so far, going Pro Se has gotten us no where. Please see my [Estate Liquidation Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/22eh7d/sg_liquidating_entire_family_estate/) for the full story. \n\nThis is one of the most loving communities I've ever participated in, and I thank you kindly for your support. \n\nAs payment, here's my [Doge](https://scontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/t1.0-9/10007428_10152316345074356_5697651264533621648_n.jpg).\n\nEDIT: If people would like to know more about me personally, to allay any fears I'm a scammer, I will do what I can to prove my identity/situation.  If needed, +/u/moolah_ has offered to vouch for my identify and provide escrow as well. \n\n**EDIT**:Added picture of the kids. \n",
