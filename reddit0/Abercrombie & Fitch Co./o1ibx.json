  "selftext": "Last night we went to Nordstrom's in Broomfield CO. and I was shocked by how terrible the selection was in the men's department, It was almost like being in a Abercrombie & Fitch. My brother, who has been working out like a freaking mad man over the last year wanted to get his measurements done, no one there knew how to do it, nor did they even have a tape.\n\nSome kind of Indie R&B crap was thumping over the speakers, and the light were dimmed. I had to double check to make sure we were in the Men's department and didn't some how end up in the boys department.\n\nWe are both large men, my brother is 6' and is a very cut and solid 210lbs, I am 6'4\", 235lbs (ok 240, back off me, the holiday's just past!) and we could find nothing even close to our size. Almost every sweater they had stopped at large, there were a few XL but I could find no XXL.\n\nSorry for the rant, I was just shocked at how bad the selection was, and how childish the men's section was. Do any of you still shop there? Is the Flat Irons store just a bad example of Nordstrom's?",
