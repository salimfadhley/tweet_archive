I have already had all the customers leave, the last guy leaving after using our bathroom a long while. Finally, cleaning time! So happy, I sang to myself until I noticed a person was at the front register, staring a the menu. My colleague was still getting furniture and had allowed in an elderly couple after close! Nearly everything was clean, and the only drink material available was an extra shuttle of Pike Place Roast we had forgotten to empty a hour or so before. I turned to the couple politely with: &quot;I am sorry, sir, but we are actually closed now.&quot; The immediate change in his expression? Frightening. He was livid and began to raise his voice, &quot;You mean you won&#39;t sell me coffee?!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, sir, we are closed, the beverages we have for sale during our open hours are now gone--&quot; referring, of course, to the coffee from the other brewers I had already poured out. He starts again, very confrontational, asking what time it was and where my supervisor was, for he would like to speak with him. &quot;After all, y&#39;all are in the business to make money and SELL COFFEE, aren&#39;t you?!&quot; Hmm. Good point, sir, I shall go fetch my supervisor....</p>\n\n<p>I retrieved the shift, who was not at all happy about this. The angry pseudocustomer begins throwing a tantrum at the shift about ME, and how I refused to sell him coffee. My shift looked around and saw the old and untouched brewer. He smiled. I smiled. He then said, &quot;Well, pour them two tall ones.&quot; I did exactly that, smelling and feeling how long the now lukewarm coffee had been sitting. The shift handed these to my rude visitor, who then piped up: &quot;Ain&#39;t you gonna take my money? Don&#39;t you WANT my money??&quot; My shift then smiled and said, &quot;No sir, I don&#39;t. Now, have a good night.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man and his sycophantic wife do not leave immediately and he begins to lecture me, yelling, when eventually my shift starts to walk them out. Meanwhile, he shouts, &quot;You people ought to learn to make money. You&#39;ll survive that way.&quot; I asked him again in an even tone not to yell at me. He got louder--&quot;Y&#39;all need a lesson in running a business!!&quot; I said then, &quot;Sir, I told you <em>not</em> to yell at me.&quot; On the same kind of note, with few further interactions, my colleague locked the door on them as soon as my last words hung.</p>\n\n<p>This man is obviously right. A multi-million-dollar corporation such as Starbucks definitely needs a lesson in how to run a business. It&#39;s perfectly obvious that that CEO of ours has no idea what...oh wait. The customer isn&#39;t always right. The level of ridiculousness with which one can act in a public place astounds me. If he wanted coffee that badly, 7-11 stays open and charges cheaply for common bellywash.</p>\n\n<p>I do hope it is understood that I was merely venting about one ridiculous pseudocustomer. I adore the majority of my customers and they made my day yesterday. I appreciate them greatly, and hope this is received in its intended voice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
