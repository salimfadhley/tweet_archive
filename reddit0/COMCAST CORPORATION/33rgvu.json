  "selftext": "Brenham is a cozy little town, snuggled off 290 halfway between Houston and Austin. We have bluebonnets, a historic downtown, and an awesome baseball team. Oh, and we're also home to BlueBell Ice Cream. \n\nIn recent months, especially now, Brenham has been inundated with news vans, reporters, and press coverage than we've had in recent times, and certainly more than we truly care for. But I want to tell you some of what those channels on the TV don't. \n\nBlueBell is the second largest employer in Washington County. Nearly everyone in this town works at BlueBell, knows someone who works at BlueBell, or is related to someone who works at BlueBell. From the time you're born in this town, you are surrounded by BlueBell culture. Babies in \"I get cranky without my bluebell\" onesies, bluebonnet pictures with a bowl of ice cream, and so many other things go so far to show how much BlueBell means to this community. \n\nHowever, BlueBell isn't just a popular business with insanely good ice cream and loyal fans. I've lived here most of my life. No one company has had a greater positive impact on my sweet Brenham than BlueBell. It's not a megacorp, controlling, evil Comcast corporation. BlueBell gives. BlueBell has to be the most philanthropic for-profit business ever. \n\nAnyone from Brenham will tell you great things about what Bluebell does for us. They create huge amounts of jobs, tourism revenue, and visibility, yes. But they also give back to the community in so many ways. Our acquatic center was built primarily with donations from Bluebell. They make constant donations to the service organizations and clubs of Washington County. They buy animal projects from kids at the Washington County Fair, helping them with scholarships. They constantly and consistently give. That's what makes them great. \n\nToday, Brenham rallied for Support Bluebell Day. Everyone in town has a Bluebell shirt on, with posters in the windows of businesses proudly displaying \"WE SUPPORT BLUEBELL\". \n\nBlueBell is a great company. Has been for 108 years. \n\nI just thought everyone should know what the fuss really is about.\n\nTL;DR- Bluebell is more than ice cream and deserves support. \n\nPlease feel free to share! ",
