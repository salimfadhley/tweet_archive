Reddit [single-handedly](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12qfps/happy_birthday_emma/c6xd1to) delivers the best gift of all.\n\nTop comment:\n>She's one of those few women who is so hot that, given an opportunity, I would have sex with her. For sure. [+103](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12qfps/happy_birthday_emma/c6xcl2e)\n\nGuys, I know this is kind of an unpopular opinion but seriously: I think that there are a lot of women that are pretty or whatever, and they're just your run-of-the-mill sex object, not really worth your time. It happens to me a lot, where one of these normal 8/10 girls will, you know, ask me for my boner. I have to pass on it, because not only does she not understand where I'm at intellectually, she just doesn't possess the sense of humor and depth that Emma Sagan has.\n\n>Can we all agree that what makes this girl so attractive is that remarkable wit and her undeniably cute reaction to everything? She's such a class act and I couldn't be happier to see her succeeding in such a back stabbing job field (Hollywood). [+13](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12qfps/happy_birthday_emma/c6xefys)\n\nComment recycled from OAG Circlejerk Inc\n\nAnd what le gem can we find in this thread's [graveyard](http://i.imgur.com/sufsS.jpg)?\n\n>Say whaaat. We're celebrating my little sister's 19th birthday today, and she looks almost exactly like this chick. Weirdness. -12\n\n>>Dear (commenter),\n\n>>I hope that you take this in the most positive way, but assuming that your sister does, in fact, look like Emma Stone, I would quite like to bang her.\n\n>>Now, I assure you, it would be very classy. I'd take her to a nice dinner. We'd have a delightful conversation. I wouldn't invite her back to my place--not on the first date, that's not classy, you see. We'd go out again. Maybe another meal. Maybe some mini-golf. Maybe we'd go rock climbing. That sort of thing. The point is, it would continue for a month or so, until one day, when the time is right, I would (with her permission) insert my phallus in all of her secret places.\n\n\n>>Kind regards (both for you and your sister)  [+24](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12qfps/happy_birthday_emma/c6xco3b?context=1)\n\nSo I'm walking through the mall with my 19 year old sister, who I must admit, is quite the looker. It's her birthday and I told her I'd get her whatever she wanted. While standing in line at the food court, you, a knight in shining Slayer shirt and sweatpants and a visage protected by scruff, randomly comes up to me and says the preceding words. The elegant delivery of your describing how you would date my sister, and also stick your dick in her crazy, is so polite and genuine that I feel compelled to upvote you glorious magnificent bastard. Knowing my sister, and women in general, I am sure that the best gift to give to her is also the most priceless: Unsolicited requests for sex with a stranger, followed by sex with that stranger. [And she would be privileged to accept it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12qfps/happy_birthday_emma/c6xensj)\n\nFucking reddit.",
