Recently, some things have changed and co-signer \"B\" agreed to co-sign on the consolidated loan as well (this person has essentially perfect credit and financial history).  I have been given an offer from Wells Fargo (with the co-signer) for consolidation of the two loans with either a 4.99% variable interest rate, or an 8.27% fixed interest rate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy plan is to over-pay the consolidated loan first (since it will be the largest loan I have) at an accelerated rate to pay it off as fast as is financially feasible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe question is, do I risk the variable interest rate since I will be over-paying, or should I just go with the fixed interest rate to guarantee it doesn't ever spike?  Or, in other words, how much and how often do these variable interest rates usually change?  Does Wells Fargo have a history of drastically changing the variable interest rates unexpectedly?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease let me know if there is any other information that would help someone providing advice, I am happy to provide it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThank you in advance.",
