A couple months ago one of my friends spilled some of my white russian on my laptop keyboard while trying to show me a stupid fucking picture, and I used my background to follow through on a 12 step system that I had to use again today. My cat decided to be a bitch and tip a full can of beer onto my keyboard while I was watching Dexter today, so I just finished proving this method for a second time. Both times my laptop was on! My laptop still runs perfectly, and I can guarantee that this shit will work if you are lucky, and are able to take the device apart and put it back together without causing further damage. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> \nPanic. This state will release the adrenaline you need to quickly follow through on the next steps of this process. You want to go through these steps in about 5-10 seconds, but you might be able to get it down to 3 seconds if you&#39;re fast/lucky enough.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> \nImmediately grab the object that is spilling the liquid (e.g. soda can, beer bottle, cup of milk...etc). If you dropped your phone in water...you might be fucked, but it&#39;s still worth it to move on to the next steps (assuming you get lucky, and act quickly). It&#39;s always better to have less of w/e liquid it is causing havoc inside your electronics. Grab the can/cup spilling the shit, get it out of the way, and move on to the next step at the speed of lightning. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>\nIf the device is a laptop or cell phone, turn it upside down as quick as you can, and keep it upside down while you follow through on the next couple steps. Your goal is to stop the liquid from making its way further into the more critical components of the device, and drain it out as much as possible. 2-3 seconds may have passed by now, so don&#39;t waste anytime using your superman super speed for the next step...because it&#39;s absolutely critical to do it quick. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>\nSHUT THAT FUCKER OFF, AND PULL OUT THE BATTERY! This will keep the device from shorting out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> \nCuss at yourself, your friend, your animal, or whoever caused this problem in the first place. If you&#39;re like me, your animal or friend spilled something on your laptop because they are fucking dumber than a life form suffering from down syndrome on bath salts. This will help you come down from your adrenaline rush, so you can gather the supplies you need to resolve this problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 6:</strong>\nYou should still be cussing like a sailor that stubbed his toe while you&#39;re getting everything you need to run to the store. Make the life form feel like an olympic athlete that slept through their event. Get your shoes, wallet, etc...and make your way to your local CVS or Walgreens (this is where I usually go, because they have everything you need). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 7:</strong>\nContinue cussing in your mind while driving to the store, and get pissed off at any idiots that can&#39;t drive for shit. Once you get to the store, buy the following: the cheapest tooth brush they have, two cans of air, the cheapest/smallest bottle of 70% isopropyl alcohol you can find, and a set of small screwdrivers/flatheads that will fit the screws that hold your device together. You may also need <a href=\"https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=types+of+pliers&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JyDjUfq_HsH5ygGI2YGoCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQsAQ&amp;biw=1093&amp;bih=486#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=SmqaF5tZUNYa8M%3A%3BuJOqyuYXVT6gcM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fimages2.cableorganizer.com%252Farticles%252Fpliers-different-uses.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cableorganizer.com%252Farticles%252Fdifferent-types-pliers-what-they-are-for.html%3B300%3B200\">pump/slip joint pliers</a> for leverage. I also have a bunch of guitar pics laying around that come in handy, because most laptops/cell phones have pieces that snap together (so you run the guitar pic around the edges to avoid damaging the device). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 8:</strong>\nIf you&#39;re lucky enough to have a smart phone or another laptop/desktop computer around that hasn&#39;t been violated by stupidity, then use it to find a youtube video of someone properly taking apart the device that you will be working on. This is very important, because there are often ribbons that need to be disconnected, or hidden screws that could potentially damage the device if not removed properly. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 9:</strong>\nFollow the video instructions, and take that bitch apart. Your goal is to reach any area of the device that may have liquid on it, so you might not have to take it apart entirely...cell phones are a lot easier, but laptops don&#39;t usually have to be taken apart 100% (e.g. there&#39;s no reason to do anything with the screen, because the majority of these accidents will happen to your keyboard). Use your guitar pic to gently undue any components that are snapped into place (you may see the person in the video using other tools for this step, but a guitar pic will do the job).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> \nOnce you&#39;ve successfully reached the afflicted areas, it&#39;s time to break open that isopropyl alcohol, and ready your other tools. Dip the toothbrush in the isopropyl alcohol, shake it off a little, and gently rub the areas of the circuit board/ribbons/keys that were doused in the liquid. I focus mainly on the circuit boards and the keyboard...but it&#39;s always a good idea to hit everything while you&#39;re in there. Don&#39;t let the alcohol stand for too long, so only do small areas at one time. Use your canned air to dry the surfaces that you applied the isopropyl alcohol to, and again...only move on to a new area with the isopropyl after you&#39;ve dried the previous area thoroughly with the canned air. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 10:</strong>\nOnce you&#39;re convinced that there is no more liquid in the device, put it back together. It might be a good idea to wait a couple hours before putting the battery back in, and turning it on...just in case. Typically, if you used the isopropyl alcohol and canned air correctly, you can try turning it back on about 5 minutes after it&#39;s reassembled. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 11:</strong>\nIf your buddy spilled the shit on your device, turn one of the bottles of canned air upside down, and spray them with it. Don&#39;t get too close, because the liquid air that comes out in a white mist is colder than Mr. Freeze&#39;s spunk juice. I like to attack an arm, but the neck is one of the worst areas to get hit by this mist...it stings for the next 30 minutes. Again, be weary of being to close or spraying too long...you can give someone frostbite if you&#39;re being too much of an asshole. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 12:</strong>\nPray, if that&#39;s your thing, and hold your breath...put the battery in, turn it on, and hope that the device starts up like normal. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Grab the can of soda to stop the flow of liquid, tilt the device upside down, shut it off, and remove the battery. Run to CVS or Walgreens to buy 70% isopropyl alcohol, 2 cans of air, a toothbrush, and a set of small screwdrivers/flat heads that will fit the screws of your device. Pull up a youtube video on a separate device of a person taking apart your device the right way, and follow their instructions. Use the toothbrush and isopropyl alcohol to clean the affected areas, and dry with the canned air. Put the device back together, pray, and turn it back on.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
