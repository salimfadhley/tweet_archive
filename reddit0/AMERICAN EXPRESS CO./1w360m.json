  "selftext": "Most of us are familiar with the Salad Oil scandal of 1963 and the repercussions that followed. For the sake of the few that may not be aware of the Salad Oil scandal, I will give a brief background below before trying to think like Warren Buffett.\n\nBackground of the Scandal\n\nThere was a fellow by the name of Anthony De Angelis who had started a company in 1955 to exploit the U.S Government\u2019s Food and Peace program that aimed at selling surplus food to Europe for cheap. The company\u2019s name was Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Co. and De Angelis had been successful (for a scam artist). By 1962 he was a large player in the market and thought he could make more money by attempting to corner the market.\n\nCornering the market consisted of attempting to buy up all, or most of the current capacities supply (through futures), essentially creating an artificial demand, in turn driving prices of both current soybean oil inventories up (that he owned) and the future contracts (that he bought), for a large profit. De Angelis planned (and succeeded) to also use these inflated inventory values to further finance additional companies, through collateralized loans (against his current inventory).\n\nAmerican Express around the same time was entering into the warehousing business and had a specialized unit that made loans to businesses based on inventories. Essentially, De Angelis took these receipts from American Express to a bank or broker and had them discounted for cash. He soon realized this was a very easy way to make money and began falsifying inventory, using seawater.\n\nAmerican express was also duped when inspecting the warehouse. Elementary science teaches us oil is more viscous than water thus it sits on top of the water. When the inspectors checked the tanks their instruments only inspected the top of the tanks and some tanks also had pipes to transfer the oil between one another.\n\nLink to Continued Article Below \n\nhttp://www.gurufocus.com/news/244542/standing-in-the-shoes-of-the-oracle-from-omaha-american-express",
