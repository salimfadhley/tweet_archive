HTC and Samsung both give you, pretty much, everything I&#39;ve seen people bitch about on this sub for the past six months and no one is satisfied. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>M9:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The M8 was a fantastic phone with great design, all I wanted from it was a better camera and better button placement. WOW, HTC listened to what the people wanted and now everyone hates them because  of it?! So, whats the deal? Did you want them to scrap the build that pretty much brought HTC back from the dead? God damn, if you <strong>don&#39;t</strong> have an M8, you can still buy an M8 off eBay, or buy the new M9. If you have an M8, then why would you upgrade anyways? Give HTC a damn break they took a great phone and made it better.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>S6:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>You all complained about the boring design so they remade the whole thing, oh but it doesn&#39;t have an SD card slot an replaceable battery so Samsung=Hitler. They released an actual innovative design and you&#39;re all focused on storage space. Yes, it&#39;s too bad the slot is gone, but most people don&#39;t even use the SD card slot. (Believe it or not this subreddit isn&#39;t the majority of android users) So, are you people seriously going to continue this stupid anti-samsung circlejerk? I swear if the S6 had a replaceable battery, SD Card, money dispenser, bacon maker, fleshlight/dildo, gaming pc, unlimited gigabit internet for your home, sports car, and hot wife/husband, and you&#39;d find some stupid ass reason to hate Samsung.
