  "selftext": "Okay after doing my thirty games of Ashabel for my stream, I have a lot of little requests that I would like fixed interaction wise for her abilities, since there were a lot of things that I felt made her more unviable due to the weird way her kit works with other characters then any of her ratios or numbers. My opinion is if some of these issues were cleaned up, she would be a much better feeling character.\n\nI do have videos of these and will try to find the time stamps tomorrow but I want to get this post out to get opinions over whether or not some of these should be kept or removed. \n\nA) Freia's dash causes her to be oddly immune to Ashabel's knockback.  This immunity either lasts a second after the dash lands or until she can move after the dash. I can't tell which. I feel like this should be changed since Ashabel at least should be able to force Freia to dash twice since Freia has a method of getting past this bit of counter play.\n\nB) Certain forms of CC and death stop Ashabel's q mid projectile. After Ashabel's q is launched(cast animation ends and she can move again) if she gets flipped by Cerulean or dies, the q lands but deals no damage. This makes it so she can't try to trade kills if she is going to die since her abilities have travel times. I don't feel that after the q is cast it should disappear. Personal opinion since things like Zalgus's e don't(least I remember people dying to it after he died). I counted 5 kills I lost because of this in total in the short time I was playing her. \n\nC) This is mentioned in another post so I'll keep it short. Ashabel being unable to knock Mina away during the travel time on fear. This makes Mina damn near impossible to deal with without a summoner on Ashabel.\n\nD) Fix z axis interactions since her primary damage is ground targeted and pairing Ashabel with characters like Desecrator can really screw with you. Desecrator's knockup makes all of Ashabel's moves miss on knocked up characters. I know this is a known problem, but I'm just adding it for the sake of addressing it. \n\n",
