I&#39;ve been flying between two countries for a few years. Now, all of us have heard stories about airport security. I personally respect TSA agents. They are always very professional and go to extreme length to do their job. Never in my life have I been subject to smallest problem of this sort at an airport, or life in general. And this is not about TSA, rather an AA employee.</p>\n\n<p>I was flying with AA yesterday and as usual they checked my travel documents which consist of my Green Card (form i-551), U.S. Travel Document for Refugees and Asylees, and Canadian Study permit before departed. They issued me the boarding pass and I flew from city A to city B where I would change planes to fly to city C. </p>\n\n<p>Upon boarding on the plane to fly from city B to city C, AA agent refused to board me on the plane stating that I did not have the right documents and I needed to have a passport. I gave her my Travel Document and explained that I didn&#39;t have a passport. </p>\n\n<p>A bit of background, I was granted asylum in the U.S. and I cannot obtain a passport from my home country. Likewise, I cannot get a U.S. passport until I become a U.S. citizen. Hence, the Department of Homeland Security issues a document known as Refugee Travel document to travel by air and return to the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>Above that, I&#39;ve flown this route many times in the past and have always been able to board on the plane with the same documents. Also, AA representatives, and Canada Border Services Agency have confirmed many times that the only documents I need to make the flight and enter Canada as a U.S. permanent resident are my Green Card and Study Permit. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, despite all that, the agent took me out of the line and sent me back to their counter where another agent told me I could not fly because I had to present a passport. I explained the situation and he told me he will pull out my luggage and asked me to stay where I was until his manager would arrive. The manager arrived after a few minutes and told me I couldn&#39;t fly on that plane because I did not have the right documentation. He then demanded to obtain all my documents and go to their office &quot;to make copies and get in touch with his people in D.C.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>While he was gone, I called AA customer service on the phone. They confirmed I had the right documents to make the journey, and that the agents at the counter should not have prevented my from boarding on the plane. After 10, 15 minutes the manager came back and said that a mistake was made and that he would book me on the next flight, since the other flight had already left. </p>\n\n<p>He offered me to fly to another city, say city D which is 100 miles away from my original destination, or I cloud fly on the next flight to my original destination, but that would land at 10pm (originally I was supposed to land at 2pm). I explained to him that there would be no way I could get to town from the airport at 10pm since the bus does not run that late. I asked him if he could arrange for ground transportation and he said he couldn&#39;t. He said that&#39;s not really his problem and I had to figure it out. </p>\n\n<p>So, eventually after going back and forth for another minute or two, and him keep telling me he was doing me a favor and giving me shitty attitude he booked me on the next flight to Toronto. Then, I requested his name and the names of the agents who were involved today so that I could report the accident to AA. He said that he would not give out any names because it would be a security threat. I asked him what he meant, and he said we should have a talk. <strong>Then he came to the other side of the counter and said because I was a refugee and &quot;you know refugees are terrorists&quot; it would put his life and his staff in danger.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I just froze speechless. People around me were blown away. He then realized what he had just said and tried to explain himself, when I cut him off and asked him to leave as our conversation was over. The guy followed me a couple of more steps trying to apologize but I was both super embarrassed in front of the people in the airport and extremely emotional for what I had just heard. The manager left and a new agent was told to confirm my flight with Air Canada to Toronto and handle the transportation of my luggage to them. </p>\n\n<p>I was given the boarding pass and got to Air Canada counter to board on the plane where I was told that my baggage was not in their possession. I called AA on the phone and told them what had just happened and AA said that my luggage was given to Air Canada. Meanwhile, Air Canada agents were saying the luggage was still with AA. Anyways, the flight left B and I landed in Toronto. My luggage never arrived. I was advised to file a baggage lost claim with Air Canada, which I did. </p>\n\n<p>After doing the paper work I headed to AA counter in Toronto and explained the situation to them and the fact that now I was 100 miles away from my destination, had no accommodation, and my luggage with all my belongings was lost. I was told that they couldn&#39;t not do anything about it and it was Air Canada&#39;s responsibility to obtain the luggage in the first place. They then gave me a case number to report a claim with AA if I choose to. </p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, my luggage was delivered to a friends house the next day. I haven&#39;t had the chance to check it, so I hope it&#39;s the right one and nothing is missing. And here I am now trying to file a claim with AA. What are my options?
