I'm rather curious as to why the majority of linux users here talk about Wayland as a 'community' effort when to the best of my, limited knowledge it is largely driven (and coded) by Intel, a corporation. \n\nFurthermore, (judging by the whole XMir brouhaha recently) it appears this corporation is perfectly willing to issue edicts that affect others in the community with as little explanation as 'Management does not approve' (re: XMir issue).\n\nI personally don't see corporations as bad but I've seen Ubuntu get a lot of flak here for being driven by a corp as opposed to say, Debian. So why does Intel get a pass?\n\nAgain, I don't know too much so just enlighten me please. Thanks",
