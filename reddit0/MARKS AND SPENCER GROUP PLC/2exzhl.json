Indeed, the M4A1-S is the second most used weapon and the M4A4 the fourth, behind the AWP. Furthermore, the ratio between the two was skewed at 64/36 in favor of the M4A1-S.\n\nValve seem to believe that good weapon balance leads to split weapon usage, perhaps it is the time they re-evaluate the M4A1-S (as well as the CZ-75)?",
