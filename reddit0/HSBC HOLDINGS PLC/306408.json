Still holding alot of negative positions e.g tesco, sainsburys, centrica, hsbc that I want to sell at break even.\n\nI'm now 28% cash and about 25% bonds and the rest equities I want to shed.\n\nHolding cash seems unproductive. I can't take out of my ISA e.g mortgage due to loss of 0% tax benefits.\n\nI'm considering the VANGUARD FUNDS PLC VANGUARD UK GOVERNMENT BOND UCITS ETF as \"better than cash\" but still agile. However I don't understand why it has a medium (4) morningstar risk rating even though it appears to be mostly UK gov gilts.\n\nIf there was a 50% equity crash ala 2000, 2008 would this be a bad thing to be holding?\n\nupdate I'm holding the etf now and it's down 0.79% first day :P",
