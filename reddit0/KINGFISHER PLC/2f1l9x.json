  "selftext": "**What is an SSD?**\n\nSolid state disk/drive. It's like a hard drive, but it has a super smart controller (which catalogs all the data and operations) and a huge array of degradable flash memory chips (just like your flash drive or phone). The cool thing about controllers and degradable memory is that it will intelligently degrade all the memory cells equally as the read/write instructions enter into the billions, leaving you with a storage device that will easily make it past 5 years of heavy use. This was not the case in 2007 when SSDs were first popularized, and it's still continuing to get cheaper and more longevic today as SSDs begin to achieve mainstream popularity.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive\n\n**What makes SSDs so great?**\n\n* Speed -Seek time (the time your hourglass spins) and read speed (also what makes your hourglass cursor spin) basically don't exist. Boot times are nearly instantaneous. Everything loads, updates, and responds instantly.\n* Temps - SSDs don't get hot, really.\n* Weight - They feel like an empty metal box. Adding these to a laptop can make a big difference sometimes.\n* Size - They're tiny and light. Adding them to a case (even if you don't have any space) can easily be done with a ziptie or tape.\n* It uses almost no power. Especially awesome in laptops (one size fits all!).\n* Lifetime is measurable thanks to the smart controller, unlike hard drives.\n\n**Videos**\n\n* [Linus torture test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQjc-XW0G7Y)\n* [Eli the Computer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB-JUyQYxIw)\n* [Asus boot time comparison and a few other test (yes, SSDs are more than *just* boot times)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j84eEjP-RL4)\n\n**Does this mean I should scrap my traditional HDD?**\n\nNo. **Keep it and use BOTH**. Use it as a storage device. Put your OS and other most-used applications on your SSD, and link your torrents, downloads, music, media, Steam, etc to your HDD.\n\n**How and where do I get one?**\n\nJust order a reputable SSD from a reputable seller. They're sold pretty much everywhere now. Crucial, Samsung, Kingston, Patriot and many other companies make excellent SSDs for pretty much every usage scenario.\n\nHere's a list of great SSDs as per PCPartPicker:\n\n* [Samsung 850 Pro](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz7ke128bw)\n* [Crucial MX100](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-internal-hard-drive-ct128mx100ssd1)\n* [Samsung 840 Pro](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz7pd128bw)\n* [Samsung 840 Evo](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz7te120bw)\n* [Crucial M500](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-internal-hard-drive-ct120m500ssd1)\n* [Kingston V300](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/kingston-internal-hard-drive-sv300s37a120g)\n\n[These will beat the shit out of anything you can get in a retail machine, console *or* PC](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/188ud5pf14kyljpg/ku-xlarge.jpg). Uber hardcore mode: buy two and **Raid 0** them.\n\n**How do I use it?**\n\n* Insert into PC. It uses the exact same power and SATA hookups as a normal hard drive. Your computer really doesn't even know the difference. All it knows is that it's waaaaaaay faster. (they're so light, you can even get by with a single screw)\n* Clone OS to SSD is also an option, but I'll assume you want a fresh start.\n* Unplug old hard drive SATA connection (so it doesn't mess anything up when you install the new OS and accidentally put the MBR on the slow HDD)\n* Install OS to SSD like would with an HDD (next, next, next, finish)\n* Install main applications to SSD. Work suites and general applications should be on the SSD. Steam should be on the HDD unless you're sure you can additionally fit your games on the SSD.\n* Plug HDD back in and possibly remove OS or reformat HDD to make more space (you may need to change the boot order in the BIOS so it doesn't boot into the HDD. Removing the OS from that one will fix the problem.)\n* [**READ THIS**](http://www.computing.net/howtos/show/solid-state-drive-ssd-tweaks-for-windows-7/552.html). It will teach you how to disable the pagefile and other things SSDs don't need.\n* Never defragment it. It doesn't benefit.\n\n**Should I buy one right now?**\n\n[**Yes.**](#b) Back-to-school is a perfect time to upgrade your PC with an SSD. More SSD sales = more r&d funds for SSD manufacturers. More r&d = even better SSDs.\n\nEven with the games on your HDD, you're games will still be less stuttery because your HDD will be 100% dedicated to your game, whereas previously it had to handle all the constant and clunky OS stuff at the same time.\n\n\n***\n\nThis is a nonprofit educational spotlight brought to you by the \\/r/PCMasterRace team.
