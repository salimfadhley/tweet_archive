I was going to use it for Battlefield 3 Premium, which is listed in the Origin store link provided in the email correspondence below as one of the games over $30 you can use to apply this discount code. Evidently when I went to do this for BF3: Premium it ignores the code and didn't work. \n\nI tried it on other games over $30 listed in the same exact link and it applied.. Below is the exact word for word e-mail terms about this coupon code.\n\nThanks EA for this broken game, and a coupon code that isn't even valid for a game I actually wanted.
