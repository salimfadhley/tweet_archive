But how is this even close to what is potentially at stake here?</p>\n\n<p>To start with, the max EPA fine, that 18B figure, is for the roughly 500k vehicles in the US. It&#39;s highly unlikely that the fine will be that high, but even at 10% of the max amount, it comes to 1.8B for those 500k cars. This leaves another 10.5m cars in the rest of the world - aren&#39;t there going to be fines on them as well? Presumably, most of these 10.5m cars are in the EU - not a place known for being soft on corporate fraud. Even if we assume that the EU fines are similar to those of their American counterparts (and assessed at 10% of max), we could be looking at around 20B of additional fines, taking the total fine cost to ~$22B</p>\n\n<p>Now, the cost of refitting each car comes up - if AdBlue systems need to be refitted, design, install, and hardware costs could easily come to several thousand per car - even a very conservative estimate would be 1k per car - equating to another $11B. It&#39;s possible that VW could avoid this by using software updates to &quot;fix&quot; the emissions issues, but this would likely do significant damage to power and mpg stats, and invite far more consumer blowback.</p>\n\n<p>Now we get to the consumers - the actual owners of these vehicles. Regardless of the fix VW uses, they&#39;re not going to be happy - a software reflash would significantly compromise power and mpg, while a AdBlue refit would be time-consuming, add weight and complexity, compromise space, and require regular upkeep. Either way, the owners of these cars almost certainly have legal standing to sue VW. An extremely conservative estimate of a $500 payout per owner would result in another $5B of costs to VW, not counting legal fees.</p>\n\n<p>Now, on to dealerships. Every VW dealer has been hit hard by this scandal, in terms of sales (hundreds of thousands of TDI vehicles are now unsellable), reputation, and eventual service burden to complete recalls. VW has pushed additional incentives to help dealers recover, but there will be inevitable lawsuits, disputes, etc. A conservative estimate of worldwide dealer-incurred costs could be ~$2B to VW.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there&#39;s the sales hit to VW. Roughly 25% of VW vehicles sold in the US are diesels, and setting aside current sales bans, this category is never going to recover. Only looking at affected vehicles, VW sold roughly ~2m a year (11m between 2009 and 2015) - sales of perhaps $50B per year. Very conservatively, these sales will be cut by 50%, costing VW $25B of sales yearly. This might translate into a net cost of $2B, but doesn&#39;t even begin to account for sales of other VW diesels, let alone all other VW products.</p>\n\n<p>So, we&#39;re now at a total cost to VW (not counting reputation, larger sales decreases, etc) of about $40B, against a market cap of $53B. This is a massive amount. I&#39;m not saying that VW, the largest auto maker in the world, is going to go down because of this, but the costs associated with this seem to be incredible.</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think?
