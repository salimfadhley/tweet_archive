He recently complained of \u201cdisappointing performance\u201d in dyed-in-the-wool American companies like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Kraft Foods.\n>\n>In the latest filing for Buffett\u2019s holding company Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has been drastically reducing his exposure to stocks that depend on consumer purchasing habits. Berkshire sold roughly 19 million shares of Johnson & Johnson, and reduced his overall stake in \u201cconsumer product stocks\u201d by 21%. Berkshire Hathaway also sold its entire stake in California-based computer parts supplier Intel.\n>\n>With 70% of the U.S. economy dependent on consumer spending, Buffett\u2019s apparent lack of faith in these companies\u2019 future prospects is worrisome. \n>\n>Unfortunately Buffett isn\u2019t alone.\n>\n>Fellow billionaire John Paulson, who made a fortune betting on the subprime mortgage meltdown, is clearing out of U.S. stocks too. During the second quarter of the year, Paulson\u2019s hedge fund, Paulson & Co., dumped 14 million shares of JPMorgan Chase. The fund also dumped its entire position in discount retailer Family Dollar and consumer-goods maker Sara Lee.\n>\n>Finally, billionaire George Soros recently sold nearly all of his bank stocks, including shares of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. Between the three banks, Soros sold more than a million shares.\n>\n>So why are these billionaires dumping their shares of U.S. companies? \n>\n>After all, the stock market is still in the midst of its historic rally. Real estate prices have finally leveled off, and for the first time in five years are actually rising in many locations. And the unemployment rate seems to have stabilized. \n>\n>It\u2019s very likely that these professional investors are aware of specific research that points toward a massive market correction, as much as 90%.\n>\n>One such person publishing this research is Robert Wiedemer, an esteemed economist and author of the New York Times best-selling book Aftershock. \n>\n>Editor\u2019s Note: .\n>\n>Before you dismiss the possibility of a 90% drop in the stock market as unrealistic, consider Wiedemer\u2019s credentials.\n>\n>In 2006, Wiedemer and a team of economists accurately predicted the collapse of the U.S. housing market, equity markets, and consumer spending that almost sank the United States. They published their research in the book America\u2019s Bubble Economy.\n>\n>The book quickly grabbed headlines for its accuracy in predicting what many thought would never happen, and quickly established Wiedemer as a trusted voice.\n>\n>A columnist at Dow Jones said the book was \u201cone of those rare finds that not only predicted the subprime credit meltdown well in advance, it offered Main Street investors a winning strategy that helped avoid the forty percent losses that followed . . .\u201d\n>\n>The chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor\u2019s said that Wiedemer\u2019s track record \u201cdemands our attention.\u201d\n>\n>And finally, the former CFO of Goldman Sachs said Wiedemer\u2019s \u201cprescience in (his) first book lends credence to the new warnings. This book deserves our attention.\u201d\n>\n>In the interview for his latest blockbuster Aftershock, Wiedemer says the 90% drop in the stock market is \u201ca worst-case scenario,\u201d and the host quickly challenged this claim. \n>\n>Wiedemer calmly laid out a clear explanation of why a large drop of some sort is a virtual certainty.\n>\n>It starts with the reckless strategy of the Federal Reserve to print a massive amount of money out of thin air in an attempt to stimulate the economy.\n>\n>\u201cThese funds haven\u2019t made it into the markets and the economy yet. But it is a mathematical certainty that once the dam breaks, and this money passes through the reserves and hits the markets, inflation will surge,\u201d said Wiedemer.\n>\n>\u201cOnce you hit 10% inflation, 10-year Treasury bonds lose about half their value. And by 20%, any value is all but gone. Interest rates will increase dramatically at this point, and that will cause real estate values to collapse. And the stock market will collapse as a consequence of these other problems.\u201d \n>\n>See the Proof: .\n>\n>And this is where Wiedemer explains why Buffett, Paulson, and Soros could be dumping U.S. stocks:\n>\n>\u201cCompanies will be spending more money on borrowing costs than business expansion costs. That means lower profit margins, lower dividends, and less hiring. Plus, more layoffs.\u201d\n>\n>No investors, let alone billionaires, will want to own stocks with falling profit margins and shrinking dividends. So if that\u2019s why Buffett, Paulson, and Soros are dumping stocks, they have decided to cash out early and leave Main Street investors holding the bag.\n>\n>But Main Street investors don\u2019t have to see their investment and retirement accounts decimated for the second time in five years.\n>\n>Wiedemer\u2019s video interview also contains a comprehensive blueprint for economic survival that\u2019s really commanding global attention.\n>\n>Now viewed over 40 million times, it was initially screened for a relatively small, private audience. But the overwhelming amount of feedback from viewers who felt the interview should be widely publicized came with consequences, as various online networks repeatedly shut it down and affiliates refused to house the content.\n>\n>\u201cPeople were sitting up and taking notice, and they begged us to make the interview public so they could easily share it,\u201d said Newsmax Financial Publisher Aaron DeHoog. \n>\n>\u201cOur real concern,\u201d DeHoog added, \u201cis the effect even if only half of Wiedemer\u2019s predictions come true.\n>\n>\u201cThat\u2019s a scary thought for sure.
