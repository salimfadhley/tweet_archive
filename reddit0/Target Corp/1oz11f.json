The store is to improve the image of the game, and to allow people to discover the game playing LoL directly on the store. A massive community meeting place also ;)\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** : physical shop (to improve image of LoL) connected to an online shop **with** Riot, it's just an idea, a 0,0001% project today",
