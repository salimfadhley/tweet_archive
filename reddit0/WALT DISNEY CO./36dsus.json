  "selftext": "Don't know how to start. On April 17, a friend was driving her home from school. A car T-boned them. The friend survived and is expected to make a full recovery, but my daughter was declared dead. She was fifteen. And my boys and I have been shaken up since. She was my little girl.\n\nShe's been to Disney twice. Once when she was seven and once when she was eleven. And she's a Disney freak. There's a picture in my office of her and Ariel when she was seven. One of my favorite memories is the magic that filled her eyes when Ariel sat right there, in the flesh, as if she'd come out of the movie just to see my daughter.\n\nHer favorite ride has always been the Tower of Terror. Naturally, her favorite was the one ride I'd refuse. And last time we were there, she begged and begged for me to get on with her. I refused and always sent her with one of her brothers. And since the funeral I've been kicking myself for not sucking it up and getting on one stupid ride with her. \n\nMy boys love Disney, but nowhere near as much as she did. We've had a weeklong Land/Sea vacation planned for months, and she spent hours talking about what she'd ride, looking up our resort and cruise, checking out what was new since last time, etc. We're supposed to get to WDW June 12th. It hurts so much to think that she won't be running ahead of me to get to the ToT ride.\n\nI'm a single father and my boys are 19, 17, 15, 15 (her triplet brothers) and 13. We have decided it best to go on with the trip, but every day I see them hurting. This was supposed to be the last big Disney trip before they were all grown up. And I'm still determined to see my boys have a good time, even though the hole made by the death of their sister will be unable to be filled. \n\nAnd I'm going to get on every stupid ride they want me to be on. Even the Tower of Terror.\n\nHas anybody gone to Disney after a death in the family?\n\nEdit: Thanks so much. I never expected to get so many blessings and support. I've had quite a few PMs from Disney workers wanting to make our trip even more magical. It's awfully kind, but I'll have to decline. We decided to go on this trip because we want to rebuild our lives and make a new \"normal,\" and that's my reason for declining any extras. We want to remember her, but overcome - and I have faith that Disney will make our trip magical enough as it is.\n\nHowever, to all who reached out, I would like for you to do something special to make someone's day a little more magical. You don't have to be a CM at Disney. You don't have to work at Disney at all or even be near Disney property. Just please, do something to make someone's day a little more magical. Bring your wife a coffee at work. Find a stranger and give a compliment. It's what she would want. And spend some time with your children.",
