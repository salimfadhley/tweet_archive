  "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nMy name is Andrew Alter. I work for a robotics kits & development platforms manufacturer as the principal engineer. [Verified with the mods](http://i.imgur.com/krueTd7.jpg) and pre-approved to do this AMA. Since this is a smaller subreddit, we'll keep this AMA open for about a week (possibly longer if questions keep coming in) and I'll check in once or twice a day and make sure everyone gets answered.\n\nI am primarily in charge of R&D, creating rapid prototypes using various manufacturing methods (CNC, Laser CNC, 3D printing, large run manufacturing, injection molding, etc). I then take those prototypes and work with my team to turn them into kits or prebuilt development platforms for other engineers, students, and tinkerers to learn and develop with. I am a massive supporter and active contributor to the open source community, and was the founder and main event organizer of the [Mech Warfare competition]( http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/xh1fb/mech_warfare_2012_massive_picture_gallery/) which ran for 5 years at the Intl Robogames in SF each year.\n\nMy skillset includes Electrical Engineering, & [PCB design](http://i.imgur.com/VTpEA0I.jpg), 3D modeling & various mechanical engineering, embedded & application level programming, and letting magic smoke out of circuit boards and rather expensive servos.\n\nOver the last 6+ years I have designed and pushed to market over 100 various robotics related products, dozens of robot kits, and a good number of high-end research platforms and custom contract jobs. I deal a good amount with ARM SBCs, Dynamixel Robot Actuators, and various Arduino/RPi-related tech.\n\nMy most recent role has been leading R&D of the 21st Century Robot project, which is an open source social robotics initiative that is sponsored by the Intel Corporation and the brainchild of Intel's Futurist, Brian David Johnson. We have a 70cm high-end research variant, as well as a more affordable 45cm hobbyist humanoid robot in the works. They're both based on the same software framework (Darwin-OP derivative), and share a unified design intent so the robots are easily scaled and upgraded. We're calling the first model Jimmy the Robot.\n\nMore info on the 21st Century Robot project can be [found here.](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/better-future/21st-century-robot-program.html)\n\nHere's an early test video of Jimmy walking around, and some design renders: \n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncI5ccnI1oM\n* http://imgur.com/a/UO7Rm\n\n*************\n\nAnd now, here's some various personal robotics projects I've done over the last few years!\n\nThis is my pet project, a custom humanoid robot named Giger. I started this project about 6 years ago and the work I did on it eventually led me to take on the 21st Century Robots project.\n\n* Giger in his final pre-21st Century Robots form: http://imgur.com/a/3V6S1\n* Giger's evolution throughout the years: http://imgur.com/a/e9Zx7\n* Some older videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL79DF419139C04DCE\n\nOne of the first larger quadrupeds I built:\n\n* http://i.imgur.com/yb6FO.jpg\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Z0GeIS4Pg\n\nEvolved quadruped project, Insanity Wolf:\n\n* http://imgur.com/a/ETKWC\n\nInsanity Wolf successor, Envy: \n\n* http://m.imgur.com/a/amTHN\n\nPX Quadruped Mark II - final productized version:\n\n* http://i.imgur.com/wvcI5.jpg\n\nKungfu humanoid prototypes:\n\n* http://imgur.com/a/oCCK0\n* http://i.imgur.com/Z4Xlc.jpg\n* http://youtu.be/WOIRp25odm4?list=PL62AC86BA09CECC4D\n\nPaintball Sentry:\n\n* http://i.imgur.com/fPNqh.jpg\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL_Yi-fdsc8\n\nFeel free to pick my brain!
