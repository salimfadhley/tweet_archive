The company was known simply as Heuer for over a century, and certain vintage Heuer pieces remain quite popular among collectors. In the 1980s, it was acquired by TAG, an automotive company, making it TAG Heuer; in 1999 the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate added the brand to its portfolio. Modern TAGs are popular among the mainstream, after aggressive marketing over the past decade raised the brand&#39;s profile immensely; some, however, feel that their courtship of countless celebrity &quot;ambassadors&quot;, as well as their dabbling in cell phones and sunglasses, has cheapened the brand. This impression is not helped by the fact that until recently, TAGs mainly used basic ETA movements, and weren&#39;t even assembled by the company. Lately, however, TAG has been moving in the right direction, with such notable achievements as the in-house <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REUaWzkt7No\">Mikrograph 1/100 second chronograph movement</a> and its conceptual brethren, including the <a href=\"http://baselworld.tagheuer.com/en/news-and-events-mikrogirder\">Mikrogirder</a>, precise to a half-millisecond.
