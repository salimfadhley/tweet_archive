  "selftext": "This is an iteration of a Iain deck I've played exclusively since H&P came out. I thought it was crazy and would never work, but was shocked at how strong it was! I've gone 5-1 in our weekly Netrunner nights.

This is of course counter-intuitive to what the Runner needs to do to win, so we're going to win by stalling and slowing the Corp in the 2nd and 3rd phases of the game, dumping agendas into Archives, and making a glorious last turn run at Archives, making it as expensive as possible for them to rez with whatever econ you left them with.\n\nWe'll be draining the Corp's coffers with Account Siphon, Emergency Shutdown, and Crescentus. Force them to Ice up all their servers by using John Masanori and Security Testing on any open server. The Source will make the Corp hesitate and keep Agendas in their hand, so go for a tutored Legwork if you're going for a fun 'alternate' win condition.\n\nSit back in those first few turns. Remember, Iain wants the Corp to score first! Once that's done, hit them with The Source, and make a sure meaningless runs to get them to Rez ICE just so you can De-rez it. These runs will be expensive with Crypsis, but who cares! Break their ICE, then De-rez it. Ideally, the Corp will be struggling for credits, all while you're earning a click-less 2 credits for doing nothing. While the Corp is focusing on how they're going to earn credits, you'll be either hitting R&D hard with Keyhole, or using Data Link Reversal (protected by Fall Guy) as hard as you can. After you've come close to decking the Corp, or you think victory is either in your hand or the Corp's, it's time for one final glory run at Archives, supported by Running Interference.\n\nA couple weaknesses. First: Jackson Howard. You have to assume they're going to retrieve 9 cards from Archives. He is your #1 target. Most corps won't realize that attacking archives is your main goal (it's not like your goal is printed on your Identity like Noise). Hopefully, you'll be draining their credits so hard that they'll waste his ability on econ cards. Force them to make this decision by making trashing Jackson YOUR #1 PRIORITY. Hopefully, once they figure out what your game plan is, they're already wasted 1 or 2 of him.\n\nYou're also going to run tag-me mid-way through the game with all those Account Siphons and the need to get Data Link out. \"But Bullseyetm, look at all your resources!\". Trashing all of these resources is even more of a credit drain on the Corp. Ideally, you're going to use your Fall Guys to protect Data Leak Reversal, with The Source as a secondary target. The Corp is NOT going to want to waste an entire turn and six credits trashing two Fall Guys and a Data Leak Reversal, but if they don't all the better for you, JUST KEEP DIGGING! Freelancer is an obvious weakness, so if you see that a ton in your meta that'll be a problem.\n\nA nice little discovery I made is all of this pressure on the Corp's economy and cycling through R&D does SHOCKINGLY well against HB:CI decks, I'm 2-0 against them and both victories were due to decking. Also, all these new Jinteki traps we're seeing hurt a lot less when you're saying \"Go ahead and score the first point, that just starts up my econ\" or when you're only accessing Remotes, HQ, R&D on your terms.\n\nThoughts, advice, and critiques are welcome.",
