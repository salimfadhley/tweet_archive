Reposting here with update and response.\n\nThis morning I received several DMCA requests from my ISP (Charter Communications) instructing me that Rightscorp, Inc. was seeking $20 per infraction settlement for Beatles songs I never torrented (it should be noted several of the emails were or the same song).\n\nBeing an owner of the albums on a physical format, I don't have the need to torrent. I'm competent in my browsing habits and my internet connection is secure.\n\nWould I be able to, at least this time, talk my way out of paying for this when I have no connection to it? Especially since I haven't gotten these type of notices before, it seems reasonable I could get out of it.\n\nAddendum:  Before it was taken from /r/AskReddit, /u/SSJStarwind16 mentioned that since I own physical copies of the files in question, I am technically entitled to digital versions.  They also mentioned that because the email was directly asking for money (which I've never seen before), it may be a bit more sketchy than normal.\n\nStill would appreciate some feedback in regards to what I should do next.  I'm only afraid of this coming back to bite me in the future.\n\nEdit #2: For the sake of appeasing the bot, I'm in the US.\n\nEdit #3: I realized my mild dyslexia had me typing out DCMA instead of DMCA.  I've corrected this in my posts.",
