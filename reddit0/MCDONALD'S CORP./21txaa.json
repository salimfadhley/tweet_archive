  "selftext": "I had a disturbing conversation with someone I've known for years and I'm pretty rattled about it and need to vent. (Using gender neutral pronouns to preserve whatever anonymity there might be)\n\nI stayed over at this friends house on the weekend, and I had casually mentioned that I was excited about the fact that Ontario was cracking down on unpaid internships and there is a push to make them illegal. The response I got was the complete opposite of what I expected, considering they have always been a supportive friend. They started going on about how that's just the way the working world is structured now and how people graduating from University should basically just shut up and take what they can get, because everyone had to do it now to survive. They compared unpaid internships to volunteer positions. They started talking about how Uni grads shouldn't expect a good job after completing University because University doesn't give you job skills, telling me that if people wanted work straight out of school they should just attend college. Their SO chimed in to explain that just about anyone can get a job at McDonalds and that it's easy to get promoted to team lead which looks good on a resume and can help you find other work later, so people should start at that route. And then had the gall to try to explain that in small towns there is a better chance that people find work and so people should just move out to small towns to find work if they need to if they needed to support their families.\n\nI was too shocked to really have a strong conversation while this was actually happening, but the more I cycled in my head the points that they were making the more I was completely disgusted that any human holds this opinion. First of all, I don't see how it is unreasonable for someone with a University (or college for that matter) level education to expect a full time job upon graduation. People are dumping $40,000-$100,000 educating themselves, I think it's completely reasonable that they should expect to see someone willing to hire them for some sort of actually paid entry-level position. Unpaid internships have basically taken the place of entry-level positions in our society because there are so few jobs available that people will actually take them, and so employers save money by offering them. Second, internships are offered by for profit companies, whereas volunteer positions are largely offered by non-profits to support communities. They didn't consider at all that most college courses won't give you the skills you need to get to work right away, only particular programs (which is the same for University programs). I don't think it's unreasonable for someone with a University degree to not want to work for minimum wage 13h a week at a fucking McDonalds, either. I honestly can't look at a McDonalds burger any more without being repulsed by the state of Factory Farms in North America, the waste the fast food corp produces, not to mention horrendous labour rights issues within the corporation. I would die happy knowing I never had to set foot in a McDonalds again. I also know that small town unemployment rates are usually much higher or at least just as high as in the cities, so I really don't know why the SO was making that point.\n\nMost disappointing of all, I took their attack really personally, because they know that I myself am in that category of recent grads with little job prospects (right now I work very casually at pretty good pay, but have $40,000 in student debt to worry about), and live with my mom. They, on the other hand, had their parents pay for their entire University schooling. Does their opinion mean that they feel like I am entitled to think that I deserve a full-time job with the skills that I have?\n\nI am actually sick just thinking that this is a kind of mentality that people have, particularly when they've lived their entire lives doused in privilege. I've actually made an effort to learn about the state of labour in Canada (and North America), whereas I'm sure they haven't even spent 15 minutes learning about the job crisis. I am just exhausted of trying to explain how horrible the state of jobs is here while people stand by their uninformed, uneducated opinions.\n\nAnyway, feel free to share opinions or reassurance that I'm not wrong to feel this way...\n\nTL;DR: Friend of mine whose parents paid for her university education thinks that recent grads who want f/t work are entitled, unpaid internships are legitimate.\n\nEdit: some werds, added tldr\n\nEdit 2: also, this recently posted article kinda kills the \"Just work at McDonalds\" argument (posted by /u/Axana)\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/03/28/wal-mart-has-a-lower-acceptance-rate-than-harvard/",
