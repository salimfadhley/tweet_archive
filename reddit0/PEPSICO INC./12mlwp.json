When you are describing some product, how much detail do you put into a product brand names?\n\nI've found I'll lay it out clearly.  With stuff like soda, I'll say coke or pepsi or whatever (because cola/soda seems kinda dumb to say.)  With cars and other vehicles I think it's easier to say what model it is then fail to describe a car in car terms.  When I get to less obvious products, like cigarettes or alcohol, I wonder what to do.\n\nI've always thought you can tell a difference between a character smoking Marlboro Reds and Camels, or drinking Johnnie Walker Red scotch to Highland Park 18 Year.\n\nAnyone else's opinions?",
