You can't even buy a Teemo hat anymore, or Blitz / Malz hoodies!\n\nCompare this to the [Dota2 store](http://store.valvesoftware.com/index.php?g=10) - they have some great options like a track jacket, polos, pint glasses, a mouse, a bunch of microplushes (which people trade at conventions), even an inflatable axe!\n\nI think that Riot is missing a huge opportunity by not having proper merchandising for their game. Who wouldn't buy a toy that shot out a Blitz hook at someone? Or a t-shirt or sweatshirt that appears to have fake muscles to look like Braum (along with a fake mustache included)?
