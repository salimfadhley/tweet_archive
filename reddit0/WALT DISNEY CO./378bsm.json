  "selftext": "This one's to my older sister.\n\nLook, sis. I'm a single dad. I've got four kids to take care of and a full-time job. So I really am grateful for the little bits of happiness that my kids can find on their own. \n\nSo it really sucks that since my youngest (my only daughter) was old enough to talk, you've been on your whole \"She'll-grow-up-expecting-to-be-treated-and-spoiled-like-a-princess\" jig just because you've read a few articles that somehow prove your point. Yes, I buy her princess movies. Yes, she watches them constantly. Yes, we have several Ariel and Belle shirts (at least she hasn't bought into the Elsa craze.) Yes, sometimes she plays out the movies and ropes her brothers into playing Flynn Rider or Gaston or Dr. Facilier or whatever male role she needs at the time. She'll also go right into a game of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with them, no questions asked. She'll chase her brothers around the yard with a lightsaber. And she'll be wearing her Ariel costume the entire time.\n\nSo no, she is not buying into gender stereotypes. Sis, she's fucking five years old. She doesn't know the difference between boys and girls, much less that her beloved movies are condemning her to a life of being waited on or some shit like that. She gets herself dressed and teeth brushed every morning. She helps with some of the dishes. She picks up her toys without complaining. Does that sound like \"princess syndrome\" to you?\n\nNo. It sounds like a normal fucking five year old.\n\nLook You can whine all you want about princesses to me, but don't come down on my daughter.\n\nAfter last weekend, I'm really hesitant to have you over again.\n\nLet's look at the things you did.\n\n1.) Complained about her singing like Snow White when she took the dishes to the sink. \n\n2.) Immediately after the above, brigade her. \"Sweetie, why are you singing that song? Oh, it's from that movie? Do you want to grow up doing all the cleaning? Do you want people telling you to do all the cleaning?\"\n\n3.) Berated my son for playing The Little Mermaid with her. Not many seven year old brothers will do that willingly with their sisters, much less be the one to suggest it, like my son did. And the berating came again. \"Why are you Eric? Do you want to always save your sister? Don't you want her to save herself? Why don't you guys play something else?\" Sis, let my kids have fun.\n\n4.) Turned off the TV when my daughter was watching Tangled and, later, suggested that I take that \"spoiled-teen-attitude trash\" out of my house.\n\n5.) Shot me down when I told you that I was surprising my kids with Disney for a long weekend over the summer. God, that was a mistake. \"You should take them somewhere that isn't plastic-molded. All that \"magic\" is man-made to cater to your children. Take them somewhere constructive. When my baby gets older, I'll actually be taking her somewhere real. Your kids are going to expect this all the time. You're spoiling them.\" \n\nSis. It's taken me two years to save up for this vacation. My oldest is ten. I want to take my kids to Disney while they're young. I want to see them having fun.\n\nI know we weren't really Disney kids. But every day, hundreds of people take their kids to Disney. I can assure you most of those kids will turn out fine. Every day hundreds of little girls watch princess movies. Most of them turn out fine, too, and if they don't...well, no young woman has ever ended up in a therapist's office saying, \"It all started when Ariel sold her soul for a man she never met.\"\n\nSo shut up and let my girl enjoy her goddam movies.",
