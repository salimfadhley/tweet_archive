  "selftext": "Sorry for it being so long. It's hopefully worth it.\n\nBackstory: In high school, I was slowly learning my skills in the computer industry, and networking with different people who would supply me with dead, dying, or disued computer equipment for me to learn with. By the end of my senior year of high school, I was no longer going to them with questions, but instead answering their own questions.\n\nToday I got a call from someone who I've known for a long time, who used to supply me with all sorts of interesting problems to work out. It went something like this: (G - Person who called me. M - Me)\n\nFirst, a phone call while I was getting a haircut. He left a nice voicemail. It went like this:\n\n\"Hey <pizzaboy192>, I googled you and found your LinkedIn profile, and it looks like you've got a nice job now. I've got a question for you about replacing a Cisco switch that is failing at our church. Our previous tech no longer has the time to assist us with fixing all of our issues, and I have no idea what is going on. Cisco told us that we need to replace the switch with a new model, but I'm lost how to program it. Please call me back. The church will pay you for your time if you're able to help.\"\n\nI went, grabbed and ate lunch, texted him that I'd call him as soon as possible, and enjoyed a sandwich. Then I called him.\n\nM: Hey G, I hear you're having some network trouble. What's up?\n\nG: Hi <pizzaboy192>, I was wondering if you could help. I saw you had networking administration listed on your LinkedIn so I thought I could call you and see if you'd know what to do. Before I bombard you with questions, are you able to help me with this?\n\nM: I haven't been formally trained, but I can gladly give you my input. What's the problem?\n\nG: Well, our old switch seems to be failing, so I called our old tech and he called Cisco, and they said that our old switch wasn't rated for 50Mb\\s internet, and that we need a new one to handle the faster internet.\n\nM: What was Cisco suggestion for you to do?\n\nG: Well, we'd need to replace it with a new switch that handles PoE, three VLANs, and had a NAT that could handle 50 megs of internet a second. They said it'd be about $1,000.\n\nM: That's a decent price for a Cisco product, but what's the problem with the old one? was it working fine before the internet upgrade?\n\nG: Yeah, it was working fine. That's the weird part. What they said makes sense though. Maybe our internet is too fast for this old switch.\n\n<Lots of diagnosticy talking stuffs>\n\nM: Did the internet upgrade happen around Christmas time?\n\nG: Yeah... it did... Why?\n\nM: The issue isn't that you've got too fast of internet, it's that you've got more things talking to the network. I bet there's more smartphones, tablets, and laptops connecting to the restricted access point than before, and it's causing the NAT tables to overflow.\n\nG: Why would that happen? \n\n<Explains how NAT works, Scours the internet for Cisco's default NAT times. Discovers that Cisco sets the default timeout to 24 hours.>\n\nM: Does it happen at the same time very day?\n\nG: Yes...\n\nM: Does it get fixed if you restart the switch?\n\nG: Yes...\n\nM: Call your old support guy and see if he can change the NAT timeout to 12 hours or 1 hour, or something shorter. It should fix the issue.\n\n<Fast forward a few days>\n\nG: (In email) Hey. We changed the NAT timeout to 2 hours, and we haven't had any issues. What's your address so the church can mail you a check for that diagnosis?\n\nTL;DR: LinkedIn is a valid way to determine whether or not Christmas kills networks.\n\nEdit: spelling and stuff.",
