  "selftext": "Sony has been pushing digital hard this gen but as someone who lives in the eastern US time zone I can't help but feel like I'm being shafted by going along with it. I strongly prefer to buy digital but with almost every game I've digitally purchased I have to wait until 3am to download. It almost completely defeats the purpose of preloading as it could just download in my sleep. Everyone else in my time zone can just go to the store and pick it up and some of my friends are doing that so I have to miss out on experiencing the game tonight. I know many of you will say just to buy physical instead but I feel like this is a valid complaint. If Sony wants us to buy digital then don't punish us for doing so. Is it really that much work to stagger the launch times based on time zone? I apologize if I'm coming off as entitled but Destiny is something I was planning on staying until 3am playing not waiting to launch at 3am so I can look around for five minutes until I fall asleep.
