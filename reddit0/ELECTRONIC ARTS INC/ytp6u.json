Like, if I get an apartment in Heyward near a BART station, can I take a train to the Caltrain station in Redwood city to get to work? Also, how do line transfers work? I&#39;ve done some reading on the BART website, but I&#39;ve never ridden on a train before except for in Europe this one time. We don&#39;t have these &quot;train&quot; things in Spokane. Unless you&#39;re talking about Amtrack trains to other cities.</p>\n\n<p>2) Where are the best places to look for a studio or 1-BR apartment for around $1200 a month?</p>\n\n<p>3) How easy is it to live without a car?
