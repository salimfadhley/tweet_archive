  "selftext": "Having had a very unhappy experience with an iLok protected software I'm on a mission to let people know of the problems inherent with the process. Essentially, iLok is a dongle that YOU BUY to protect the companies IP. You have to have it plugged into your computer with the current licenses installed, if you want your software to work. I'm a bit of a good guy greg when it comes to software and IP generally and buy legitimate versions. So I but the software Antares Autotune in this instance. It's been working fine for the last six months or so. Set up project studio for recording album in remote location. One track in particular relies on Autotune. Dongle doesn't work, session blown out of water. Spend half a day trying to make it work using iLoks useless customer support. Eventually discover iLok is broken. A range of options are offered, but essentially it involves me waiting for them to send me a new iLok after I send them the old one or spending more money protecting the companies IP. Instead I've decided to give up on any software that requires iLok to run and I would advise you to do the same. It's a long list. But be warned. If you don't believe me, google \"I hate iLok\" and read the stories. It's a broken system that's been designed to make money not protect software.\nAbbeyRoad\n\n\nAlmateq SRL\n\n\nAntares Audio Technologies\n\n\nAudio Ease\n\n\nAudio Research\n\n\nBrainworx Music & Media GmbH\n\n\nCelemony\n\n\nCognitone\n\n\nCrane Song Ltd\n\n\nCreative Network Design\n\n\nCube-Tec International GmbH\n\n\nCycling '74\n\n\nDigidesign\n\n\nDolby\n\n\nDrawmer\n\n\nDTS, Inc.\n\n\nDUY Research\n\n\nEast West Sounds, Inc.\n\n\nEiosis\n\n\nElysia GmbH\n\n\nEuphonix Inc.\n\n\nEventide, Inc.\n\n\nFlux\n\n\nFocusrite Audio Engineering\n\n\nGRM Tools\n\n\nIntelligent Devices\n\n\niZotope\n\n\nKIWA International Ltd\n\n\nLawo AG\n\n\nLexicon\n\n\nLine 6, Inc.\n\n\nM-Audio\n\n\nMark Of The Unicorn, Inc.\n\n\nMcDSP\n\n\nMDW Massenberg\n\n\nMinnetonka\n\n\nMu Technologies\n\n\nNeyrinck\n\n\nNomad Factory\n\n\nNotion\n\n\nOxford Digital Limited\n\n\nParsek srl Markbass\n\n\nPGMT Ltd.\n\n\nPlugorama - Muse Research\n\n\nPrinceton Digital LLC\n\n\nPSP Audioware\n\n\nQuiet Art Ltd.\n\n\nRemote Control Productions\n\n\nRNDigital\n\n\nSerato Audio Research Ltd.\n\n\nSlanecon Digital\n\n\nSoftube AB\n\n\nsolidThinking Inc.\n\n\nSonalksis\n\n\nSonic Studio\n\n\nSonik Architects\n\n\nSonnox Ltd.\n\n\nSoundfield\n\n\nSoundminer\n\n\nSoundToys\n\n\nSource Elements\n\n\nSPL Germany\n\n\nSRS Labs, Inc.\n\n\nSynaptricity\n\n\nSynchro Arts\n\n\nSynful\n\n\nSynthogy\n\n\nTac System, Inc.\n\n\nTanager AudioWorks, Inc.\n\n\nTC Electronic\n\n\nTC-Helicon Vocal Technologies, Inc.\n\nThe Sound Guy, Inc.\n\nUltimate Sound Bank\n\nUnique Recording Software\n\nUnity Technologies ApS\n\nUniversal Audio, Inc.\n\nVerance\n\nVirtual Katy\n\nWaves, Inc.\n\nWholegrain Digital Systems Write Brothers, Inc. \n\nzplane.development",
