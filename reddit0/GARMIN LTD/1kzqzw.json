  "selftext": "Hi All, \n\nSo work are tied in to the halfords cycle to work scheme, maximum of 1000 for bike and accessories and we cant add our own money to it. \n\nHave got my certificate of collection already for the maximum, and I am currently swinging towards the boardman ltd carbon but that max's me out in terms of spending, I am also a bit of a fat fuck so there are probably easier ways to save weight on a bike than carbon, IE me losing it. \n\nSo my real question is am I better off getting a lower priced bike and spending the money on gps etc? I already have spd pedals and trainers although they are mtb not road style cleats. \n\n\nUPDATE **** They didn't have a race in stock, they only had the large display model of the team carbon. So they did that for me and threw in a garmin 200 and spd pedals, just need to get shoes now. \n\nThankyou all for your advice this morning.  I now have a shiny new pedal toy :D",
