  "selftext": "**I DON'T HAVE INVITES**\n\nSo I got my One yesterday, and I really like it. Reposting my post from another forum if anyone's interested in more first impressions.\n \n> The packaging is really really well done. I had to crack it open at the post office to make sure the shipping company didn't break anything, so no unboxing pictures will be present. The box itself is made of thick cardboard. It looks sturdy, but the charger box uses the same (or, at least, very similar) material and that got a pretty big dent in it somehow (no chargers were harmed). Unboxing the phone itself, even at the speed of a person in the post office that closes in 10 minutes, was a really nice experience. The phone is big, but it fits really well in the hand (or maybe I just have larger hands than I expected). When holding something like a Galaxy Note, I had a feeling of the phone being just too big - no such thing with the One. The back cover has a finish that they call \"sandstone black\", but it's really more like sandpaper. I was slightly afraid of it scratching my hands, but it turned out to feel really nice, with no sharp edges. The design of the front panel is not particularly exciting - it's no LG G3 or HTC M8 - but it works and doesn't get in your way. The capacitive keys on the front have a really dim blue backlight - I wish it was a bit more noticeable, but at the same time I don't really care too much. It seems the backlight level varies from device to device though, so I might have gotten unlucky here. You can turn the capacitive buttons off completely and use the standard Android navbar, but I'm sticking to the buttons for now - more screen space is better, after all. The layout of the buttons is what you'd expect from your standard run-of-the-mill Chinese knockoff phone - Menu on the left, Home in the middle and Back on the right. You can remap it through the settings, but I absolutely don't understand what OnePlus were thinking when going with this layout, especially considering Google's desire to kill the Menu button completely. I'm pretty sure Samsung uses the same layout, too (WHY). I remapped Menu to Recents, and I'm thinking about going the whole way and swapping it around with the Back button, too (imagine the confusion that's going to ensue when I lend my phone to someone). The screen is really nice - I don't see the yellow tint other people notice, and the color reproduction is pretty accurate (which is to be expected, considering Supercurio works for CM now, and that guy is a huge display nerd). It's not as eye-melting as something like a Galaxy S5, and that's the way it should be, really. \n> \n> The camera may not be great, but compared to a Nexus 4, it's a big step up. I won't complain here. It can do 720p@120FPS slow-mo and 4K video, which is nice, I guess. OnePlus also advertises their front-facing wide-angle \"group selfie camera\". I don't know why people want group selfies, but it's really nice for video calls, because you get to hold the phone at a distance that's much more comfortable. The sound is pretty nice - the bottom speakers are really loud, and the headphone output has enough power to drive every pair of headphones I found. There are some issues with headset support in particular, but those should be resolved with a software update. The built-in AudioFX app is basically a reskinned DSP Manager we all (or at least some of us) know and love. \n> \n> The software is, well, CyanogenMod. The big features not present on other devices are the new camera (great) and gallery (why) apps, a custom lockscreen and a custom theme with Cyanogen Inc's signature hexagons all around the UI. There's also officially supported nightly builds of CM11 that have a lot of bugfixes and general improvements that should be merged into CM11S with an OTA update that's stuck somewhere in certification hell. I switched to the nightlies immediately - I won't miss the eye-melting blue lockscreen, the rest can be sideloaded, and I like my 24 bit / 192 kHz audio. Unlocking the bootloader and flashing the nightly was a painless process - it's basically identical to a Nexus device, except you don't need to confirm the unlocking (which wipes all of your data, by the way, so a warning could have been nice there). \n> \n> I guess that's about it for now - sorry for the jumbled thoughts, I'll edit it later.\n\nSome more stuff: I'm in Russia, used [Qwintry](http://qwintry.com/) for mail forwarding, took two and a half weeks from OnePlus to me, which is pretty nice. The touch bug seems to be there, but it's not too bad and most of the typing issues seem to be because I'm not fully used to the big screen yet.",
