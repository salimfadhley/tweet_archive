I also believe in the personal property rights of all individuals. I do not (as I am often accused by An-Caps) support authoritarian communes. \nSo now that that is out of the way I have a simple thought experiment about Starbucks which I am interested to see how An-Caps respond to.\nSuppose I am the manager of a Starbucks and come to work at that Starbucks everyday. I decide I want to run things my way and disobey the instructions I receive from corporate. I have a plan to change things up, bring in more customers, and take away customers from other coffee shops including other Starbucks establishments. I set up deals with different coffee bean suppliers who dont work with the Starbucks corporation and stop reporting on my costs and revenue to corporate. I take management of the property into my own hands. My Starbucks establishment effectively and peacefully becomes autonomous. Then one day someone from corporate comes and tells me I'm fired but I ignore them and keep working. \nAt this point in the story the person from corporate would get the police to evict me and use violence if I resist or barricade myself inside.\n\nHow is this situation handled in a stateless society?  \nIs it illegitimate for me to non violently separate my Starbucks establishment from the rest of the corporation?\nIs it legitimate for the corporation to retake the establishment by force?
