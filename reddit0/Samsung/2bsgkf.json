  "selftext": "29 days ago I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/294qj5/i_woke_up_because_something_burned_me_while_i_was/) post, talking about how my phone had burned and melted while I was sleeping. I was using the official battery and a samsung cable when it happened, and my phone was not under any blankets, or under anything at all for that matter.  \n  \nWithin a couple of days, Samsung had contacted me and told me that they would send me a replacement S4, and a box that I could use to ship my destroyed phone back to them in. During this time they were extremely cordial and polite, and seemingly wanted to genuinely help me. I was happy to oblige, because its only a matter of time until someone loses their life because of this issue. However, Samsung never sent me a replacement phone. Only a box to ship my phone back in.  \n  \nI have tried multiple times since then to contact Samsung via phone, and through their Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter accounts and have been completely ignored. When I call them, I generally am able to speak to a representative for a total of 5 minutes, and then I am placed on hold for about 30-50 minutes before either my call is disconnected, or I am transferred to a voicemail where I have left multiple messages.  \n  \nI don't know what route to take in this matter, so here I am again, hoping to get their attention again this way.\n\n---\nEdit: Some spelling\n\nAlso, to those saying that I should \"wage war\" against Samsung, I would rather go about it in a more diplomatic way than that. I want to give them the chance to do what they feel is necessary. If I feel that it is not, then things may be different. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, and hoping that a proper solution can arise without a bunch of nastiness.  \n  \n---  \nEdit 2:  \n  \nA few people have stated that I should send my phone in. I have asked Samsung multiple times when I was able to get in touch with a representative, \"What needs to be done in order to resolve this situation?\" Not once has any of them said that Samsung was waiting on me to send in my phone. If that were the issue, then I am certain that they would have let me know, as I am sure they would like to get their hands on my phone to try to find out what went wrong.  \n  \nAlso, Samsung told me that they would ship a replacement phone out with the box for me to send my phone back in. The purpose of my calls to Samsung, when the replacement phone never arrived, was to find out why it didn't arrive. During these calls, again, Samsung never stated that they were waiting to receive my phone before they sent a replacement.  \n  \nThe fact that they told me that they were going to send a replacement phone out and then did not, combined with the lack of help that I have received in my attempts to communicate with them, have degraded my trust in Samsung.  \n  \nAnother thing for the people suggesting that I send it in, as I stated in my original post, the phone has some functionality still, though I have to to some cable Judo in order to get a charger to properly connect in the charging port, due to the misshapen nature of the charging port that occurred when it melted. If I were to send it in, I would be without a phone, and I cannot afford to run out and buy a new one.  \n  \nFinally, please try to keep it civil everyone. I know that some of you guys are die-hard Samsung fans, and that is ok. I really enjoyed my s4 up until the point where it melted and burned me and I didn't receive proper customer service after the fact.\n\n---\nEdit 3: The fine folks over at HTC have [made me an offer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2bsgkf/about_a_month_ago_my_galaxy_s4_caught_on_fire/cj8rq8c) that I couldn't refuse! I'm honestly in awe of the amount of support and suggestions that I have received in regards to this issue. You guys and gals are all the best! I will update this thread with pics, so if anyone is still around when I receive my replacement, you can see them.   \n  \nI really cannot express the amount of gratitude that I have for those of you who offered help and advice for all of this. All that I can say is thank you very much.\n",
