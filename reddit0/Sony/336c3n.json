One part reads, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Finally, in regards to trade, the MPAA/MPA with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-IP trade policies such as TPP and the proposed EU/US trade agreement (TTIP)&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This here is concrete proof that corporations globally are pushing laws for their own profit at the expense of the people, this will be basically SOPA/CISPA on steroids. </p>\n\n<p>But wait there&#39;s more, they even said that they have formed an,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;MPAA/Studio working group to study and develop the next generation of criminal enforcement strategies to present to federal prosecutors&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is worse than we thought <a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a>, not only have the MPAA influenced and crafted some of the strictest copyright laws in the history of the internet for its own gain, they have been put in charge of implementing the punishments for breaking these laws.</p>\n\n<p>This whole deal is completely beyond repair and needs to be shot down, but with the majority of the world economy on board, it seems like it will be a difficult task.</p>\n\n<p>Bare in mind that the TPP not only includes copyright, but it will allow corporations to <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2015/3/26/headlines/wikileaks_reveals_tpp_proposal_allowing_corporations_to_sue_nations\">sue governments</a> for &#39;cutting into their future profits&#39; and to get the countries to repeal laws like environmental and food safety standards to maximise profits. As seen on wikileaks about the TPP:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...WikiLeaks has released the &quot;Investment Chapter,&quot; which highlights the intent of U.S.-led negotiators to create a tribunal where corporations can sue governments if their laws interfere with a company\u2019s claimed future profits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a sensitive topic of discussion right now, the UK will likely lose the NHS as well since this also allows US pharmaceutical companies to sue governments.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t know about the TPP/TTIP, they are trade agreements between major world powers that are currently being negotiated in complete secrecy with corporations playing a big role. We only know most of what we do because of wikileaks: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership\">https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership\">https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnC1mqyAXmw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnC1mqyAXmw</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also being <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/american-congress-reaches-agreement-fast-track-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-1496853\">fastracked through congress</a> so we don&#39;t have much time to stop it. </p>\n\n<p>Do WHATEVER you can to help raise awareness about this, this is a life or death situation for the internet and most of modern society.
