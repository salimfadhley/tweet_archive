Coke was of the devil, because regular Coke was caffeinated. So today, when I saw her eating a [3.5-oz bar of 85% cacao dark chocolate](http://livewell.jillianmichaels.com/caffeine-chocolate-versus-coffee-4960.html), I had to wonder to myself how its caffeine content compared to [that of Coke](http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/ingredients/how-much-caffeine-is-in-diet-coke-coca-cola-and-coke-zero.html). Turns out it's more than twice as much. And that chocolate bar has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. \n\nShe eats the chocolate because it doesn't give off a bad image, but drinking Coke does. Avoid the appearance of evil and all that. [*Hot drinks!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZXeFPpPJeI)",
