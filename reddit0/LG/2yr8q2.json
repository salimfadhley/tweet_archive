  "selftext": "[**FULL PICTURE GALLERY**](http://imgur.com/a/naAvP)\n.\n.\n.\n\n**OBJECTIVE:**\nThe objective of this project is to increase the battery capacity of the nexus 5 by swapping out the stock battery for a larger one, while still maintaining full functionality of the phone and maintaining the original form factor.\n\n**ABSTRACT:**\nA few days ago I say a post on this subreddit about the possibility of swapping the nexus 5 battery (2300Mah) with the battery from the lg g2 (3000Mah) after a quick search I found two documented instances of this mod being done [example 1](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102008505105093990793/posts/cdMJc6R8UST) and [example 2](http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/general/nexus-5-lg-g2-battery-swap-t2513133/page11) in the first example the mod caused the user to no longer be able to use wireless charging or NFC which was an unacceptable compromise for my project. the second example involved cutting away a portion of the lower speaker with a little bit of luck as far as not cutting through important ribbon cables which was again not a very acceptable procedure for me to follow. I borrowed from both examples to complete this project.\n\n**EQUIPMENT:**\n\n* Nexus 5\n\n* 3000 Mah Battery from an lg G2\n\n* Dremel\n\n* Grinding stone bits\n\n* Soldering iron\n\n* Scissors\n\n* Small screwdriver\n\n* Plastic spudger\n\n* Masking tape\n\n* Compressed air\n\n* Two part epoxy\n\n**PROCEDURE:**\nI currently own 2 nexus 5 (32gb) phones one with a cracked screen, so I decided that I would repair the screen on my old nexus5 while simultaneously upgrading the battery. (the pictures are roughly in this same order)\n\nStep 1: I orders a [lg G2 battery]( http://www.etradesupply.com/lg-g2-d800-battery-bl-t7.html) and a [screen digitizer assembly]( http://www.etradesupply.com/lg-nexus-5-d820-lcd-and-digitizer-assembly-with-front-housing-red.html) from etrade supply.\n\nStep 2: disassemble the phone using [ifixit\u2019s teardown guide]( https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nexus+5+Teardown/19016), the spudger, and small screwdriver\n\nStep 3: remove the stickers and plastic components from each battery, exposing the circuit boards (be careful not to puncture the battery in any way!!!)\n\nStep 4: using a scissors cut the circuit boards off of each battery as close to the board as possible\n\nStep 5: solder the board from the nexus 5 battery to the G2 battery \n\nStep 6: cover the contacts on the board with a thin layer of 2 part epoxy (then set aside for now)\n\nStep 6: mask off the phone using tape to keep metal dust from getting on sensitive components\n\nStep 7: use a dremel to grind down the top battery-frame-support-rib as shown in the pictures \n\nStep 8: reassemble everything in the phone except the larger plastic shielding, using the compressed air to blow each part clean\n\nStep 9: using the dremel grind away plastic on the shielding to fit the new position of the circuit board and the battery plug\n\nStep 10: finish assembly \n\nStep 11: Boot and enjoy!\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nso far I havent blown anything up and the phone has had no problems. I flashed 5.1 and rooted it. everything still works including nfc, wireless charging, and vibration. the phone does not feel any different in the hand than before. the swap was successful!!\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n**Edit: be carful of which battery you order! I have been told that certain g2 batteries have slightly different dimensions and thus will not work. You need a g2 battery that is completely flat! No raised center portion.**\n\n\n[This is right](http://www.etradesupply.com/catalog/product/gallery/id/20605/image/203548/)\n\n[This is wrong!](http://tanstartrade.ca/images/LG%20BL-T7.jpg)\n",
