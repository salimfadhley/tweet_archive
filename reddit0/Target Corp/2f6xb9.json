In retail stores and some other grocery stores (different companies), people are able to use their phone apps to pay with their gift cards by scanning them or they can type in the card number and pay that way. We cannot accept the phone app or type in the number at my store- you need to have the physical card to swipe. This has resulted in a number of  confrontations with customers and this is one of them. \n\nAt the end of a long rush, a middle aged lady in a business suit approached my register and ordered her drink. As I'm writing her order on her cup, she sighs heavily.\n\nCustomer: I hate this store.\n\nMe: (slightly surprised at the unprompted rudeness) Oh? \n\nCustomer: Yes, I hate coming here. It's so horrible you don't accept the phone app. I can't get my points when I come here. You're store is basically stealing from me and I don't appreciate that. \n\nMe: I'm sorry you feel that way ma'am. Hopefully we'll have the app soon and you can finally like our store.\n\nCustomer: I mean, the regular store has is and other grocery stores type in my number, but your store refuses to. I hope you lose a lot of business over it and eventually shut down. This store deserves it.\n\nMe: Then why don't you go to one of those stores instead?\n\nCustomer: This one is on my way to work.\n\nMe: You know you can link a new physical card to your account and use that to pay so you get your points.\n\nCustomer: I don't think I should have to. Honestly, I'm so frustrated with your store and how it treats its customers. It should go out of business.\n\nMe: Well let me make your drink ma'am and contemplate losing my job.\n\nCustomer: (finally realizing how fucking rude she's been) Oh... uh... I don't mean your job... um...\n\nShe slunk off and waited for her nonfat latte with extra extra whipped cream.",
