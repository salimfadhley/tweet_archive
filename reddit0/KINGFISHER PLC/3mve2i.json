I only picked parts in my last two computers. This build was a nightmare! The PSU came a week later than it was supposed to. I had to RMA my case twice. The first RMA - air bubble between the side panel and the isolation material. The second RMA - missing screwhole in the door hinge. A shipment with my ODD, MOBO and RAM got lost and I had to order again and wait. ASUS Installation Tool! What a great tool! In order to put the CPU inside, I had to touch the bottom of the CPU! That was really crazy and I was really scared, that it was gonna damage my CPU/MOBO. I put the CPU+Asus Tool to the socket and locked it. Holy cow! That crack after I locked it. A brutal plastic crack like when you break something. I was convinced, that my CPU+MOBO are dead. Anyway, I tried POST and it worked! OMG, a big relief! I suppose that the stupid tool was somehow deformed, because the CPU was alligned properly and the crack was from the plastic tool. But the horror continues. I was installing the MOBO into the case, and I was screwing the last screw. It fell under the MOBO! I tried to rotate the case,as long as the other 7 screws held the MOBO, but it didn&#39;t come out. So I said to myself:&#39;No big deal. I will just unscrew the MOBO, take it out, and pick the screw.&#39; Oh, how wrong I was. I unscrewed 6 screws bud the last one, man, I tried everything and couldn&#39;t manage to unscrew the bloody screw. After a few loops it would just spin and spin. I tried holding the standoff from the other side, and unscrew the screw, but no result. So I screwed all screws once again, and tried to shake the case a little bit. It worked! Dat feeling! A big relief. Then came software issues. I installed Win10 and other traditional stuff. After a day or two I connected my Logitech G502 mouse and Logitech G510s keyboard. Just after I connected the keyboard, my PC would freeze and end with a BSOD. I uninstalled Logitech Gaming Software and everything was OK. After another clean install and the installation of LGS, I tried to figure out the culprit. It was a part of the Asus AI Suite - the Asus Mobo Connect! Then another issue arose! Restart caused my computer to turn off all of my peripherals, and it just kept running. I figured out the culprit once again and it was the Asus RAMDisk! I finished my build like a week and a half ago. Yesterday, when I was installing an extra fan into the case, I accidentally sat on my side panel with a window. It was bent really bad, but I managed to bend it back to original state and there are no sings of damage, so another big relief! So after all the traps from ASUS I am here prepairing to overclock my CPU, because my RAM runs just on 2400MHz, but I think that a little bit of overclocking is gonna fix that. Ofc, I am waiting for my pre-ordered Asus ROG PG279Q! And a PASCAL GPU but that is really a long term waiting. :)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/BQCNbv\">PCPartPicker part list</a> / <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/BQCNbv/by_merchant/\">Price breakdown by merchant</a></p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Item</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Price</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>CPU</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80662i76700k\">Intel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">\u20ac353.26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>CPU Cooler</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/part/scythe-cpu-cooler-scmgd1000\">Scythe Mugen MAX 97.2 CFM CPU Cooler</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">\u20ac42.35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Thermal Compound</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/part/arctic-cooling-thermal-paste-acmx4\">Arctic Cooling MX4 4g Thermal Paste</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">\u20ac6.60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Motherboard</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-maximusviiihero\">Asus MAXIMUS VIII HERO ATX LGA1151 Motherboard</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">\u20ac227.59</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Memory</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-memory-ble2k8g4d26afea\">Crucial Ballistix Elite 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2666 Memory</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">\u20ac147.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Storage</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz75e500bam\">Samsung 850 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5&quot;
