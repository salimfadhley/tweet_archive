We seem to believe that those relationships are important, to the point where, when a couple breaks up or divorces or when two friends get into a fight or when a loved one dies, we consider it a huge loss. But I think that&#39;s wrong.  </p>\n\n<p>We often say that our society is overly consumerist and materialistic. We criticize people for caring so much about material possessions, wealth, entertainment, fashion, and celebrities. We consider those things to be distractions from important issues - opiates of the masses, to borrow a phrase. By contrast, we consider it okay to care about relationships, love, friendship, sex, and intimacy, and it shows. These things are nearly ubiquitous themes in literature, art, film, television, and music. You open any newspaper or magazine and there will be some &quot;Dear Abby&quot; type expert who will give you advice on these things, not to mention endless articles on intimate relationship tips (&quot;10 tips for a healthier marriage&quot;, etc.). There are even scientists, who are paid with taxpayer money, who actually do research into these relationships (I guess curing AIDS isn&#39;t as important anymore). We even offer certain legal and financial benefits to certain coulpes in the form of marriage. It&#39;s obvious that society - especially western, developed society - elevates intimate relationships to a level above the distractions I mentioned earlier.  </p>\n\n<p>I, however, don&#39;t see much of a difference between these relationships and the distractions I mentioned. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s okay to be upset when your friend, say, moves away but it&#39;s not okay to be equally upset if your favorite team loses the Super Bowl. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s okay to cry if/when your SO leaves you but it&#39;s not okay to cry just as much if/when your favorite TV show gets cancelled. Because at the end of the day, both intimate relationships and the distractions I mentioned are just things we do do keep us entertained, busy, and happy. They raise our endorphin levels. They&#39;re things we do when we&#39;re bored. They&#39;re things we do for fun. So why are intimate relationships considered more &quot;valuable&quot; than the other things I mentioned? Why is it, that when people talk about what Kim Kardashian tweeted, we think they&#39;re wasting their time, but when someone sets up a dating profile or goes to a movie with a friend, we think it&#39;s totally cool? Why is it that, when people line spend x amount of time, energy, money on following sports, we think they&#39;re crazy or stupid, but when they spend even more time cultivating these relationships I&#39;m talking about, we think it&#39;s okay?</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, we kind of already subconsciously view these relationships as entertainment because we tend to differentiate between these relationships. For example, we treat the relationship between frat bros who spend all their time smoking weed, getting drunk, and trying to get laid as a shallow, meaningless relationship - fun. By contrast, we treat a real, serious, deep friendship between two people - forged, tested, and tried over the years - as a &quot;real&quot; friendship, sort of like Turk and JD. As another example, we realize that a casual fling between two people is just that - casual fun. However, we afford a certain respect to a long, committed, multi-year or multi-decade relationship and call it &quot;true love&quot;. When two drunken college students in Cancun hook up in a porta-potty, we know that it&#39;s just something they&#39;re doing to derive some cheap physical pleasure, and we treat that differently than two people who genuinely love each other making love. My point is that we already accept that certain relationships are entertainment (and therefore no different than fashion, celebrity culture, etc.) , and we treat others as though they&#39;re different. My point is that there is no difference.  </p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: Intimate relationships such as friendship, romance, and sex are entertainment, just like celebrity culture, sports, reality TV, fashion, or the newest gadgets, and there&#39;s no difference between shallow relationships and deep relationships.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hello, users of CMV!
