When I purchased the gift card, I also went through fat wallet 1% cash back on the purchase (saved $1). The site I used to buy the card also had a $5 off $75 purchase coupon (saved $5). The gift card was delivered electronically instantly. After purchasing the card, I signed up my email to get $5 off a purchase at home depot (saved $5).
