Will try to be as brief as possible:\n\n* Last week of August have eye doctor appointment and purchase new glasses using American Express Card\n\n* First week Sept glasses arrive and have huge scratch on them\n\n* Given glasses until new pair arrive at which time I will receive pair with no cosmetic damage.\n\n* Next few weeks place calls requesting updates; calls not returned, etc.\n\n* Today actually get through to human being; no ETA on glasses.  Express desire to return current, cosmetically damaged pair, move on with life and told that it requires manager approval, but no manager exits in the department.\n\n* Considering customer service issue cannot be resolved (e.g., no undamaged product delivered) thinking of initiating a charge back.\n\nWould like thoughts on that as a solution?\n\nThanks. \n\nEdit: *Chargeback.  I cannot spell or proofread. \n",
