Please accept my gratitude for the informative posts that are made here, and for the personal stories that you have shared about your in game experiences. Ever since the Christmas holidays I had been very vocal about my interest in performing a FLAWLESS RAID. I am the founder of my clan, and I thought it was important for everyone in our crew to be aware of this effort and to also appreciate that this is perhaps the best \nchallenge that the game offers. My clan was not quite ready to take a real stab at the flawless raider trophy as we had conflicting schedules, and I was quite determined to roll with my homies that I prefer to game with. Move forward several weeks, and I was beginning to apply pressure on my guys. Now let me get to the details:</p>\n\n<p>Jan 5th\nwe put together about 5 guardians from our clan and a 6th from an ally. In my head I was ready to dedicate time to a flawless run, but the others were not taking it seriously. Example, guys were not running with their best character. Right off the bat pretty much, my man Greenarcher13 gets disconnected, and our Clan Admin Xeltyr dies as a low 28 Titan. I ask if we should start over, and the team responds by saying lets not.</p>\n\n<p>Jan 6\nI send a few message around to my trusted guardians via the Destiny app saying 10 pm est - be there. I make an arrangement with my wife and get into it 30 mins earlier instead. I act patient wait for my dudes to sign in, and it begins to not look good at all. only 1 of my guys is available from the original 6 guardians in the clan. I share with Greenarcher13 that I intent to be patient and wait for a few more people to jump in. Next, Ballzier,  a 2nd wave guardian to our clan joins the team. Following that this younger guy Incapacities from our clan joins, and is somewhat interested to participate. Slowly gaining momentum, I invite Jdtinsley, a dude I played with once or twice on Crota, barely know him. Of course, he&#39;s got the NAT type, so my as fireteam leader I can&#39;t even hear the guy. In the words of the NYHC band KILLING TIME, &quot;two steps forward, one step back&quot;. At this stage there is literally no one else ready to go. A few minutes pass by and it seems like we are losing steam and people are suddenly saying, &quot;ok, im gonna help out my buddy with this or that, hit me up of this gets off the ground&quot;. What happens next was a beautiful moment in our respective clan histories and is testament to not burning bridges. I invited a dude who formed a previous Destiny clan that I was in. I left that clan, and formed my own, because I could never coordinate to raid with those guys. Our 6th man and point guard was rosey981. I&#39;d say he was the more experienced out of our whole lot. Once he came in, and I told him that we&#39;re doing flawless I start feeling the anticipation to drop into Venus. As we are gearing up, I get a message from a guy I had invited to join, and knew we could benefit from. I couldn&#39;t rightfully boot someone from the fireteam without giving them all a fair chance. Generously, Incapacities volunteers to leave the fireteam as he doesn&#39;t care too much about trophies, and prob didn&#39;t think we&#39;d do it on our first real night anyway, so he left, and gave the slot to likeaboss8. Before we did that, we HAD to go through a game plan, because some of us had never played together, and I needed to go over everyones role. Call me crazy, but before this, I even drew up a plan for match ups, player types, and strategies, so I/we were prepared. Relic holders got assigned, and everyone knew who their wing man was, and we were ready for what might be a long night. Rosey981 recollected that he had consciously tried doing the flawless over 50-75 times. The rest of our group had barely even conceived of the notion.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 1: Everything was just kosher right up until the green ooze shit started coming out near that Templar section. JD, the guy with the NAT type either missed instructions, or had a split second of carelessness and he ended up dying as a result. He couldnt cleanse in time. I admit to being a bit annoyed, but I didn&#39;t say anything. I was remaining positive, and encouraged the other guys that we got that far. Not bad, right?</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 2: We make it to that exact stage, and even defeat the Templar in about 15 mins or less. This whole time we are starting to notice lag and wee glitches where guys aren&#39;t getting fully cleansed etc... Sure enough JD still has the red fog thing over his head meaning he needs to be cleansed. Problem is, the relic holder can&#39;t fix it. It won&#39;t go away, and we need to advance to the next stage. Because I can&#39;t even communicate with this guy, I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m losing control over the squad that I feel responsible for putting together. Thankfully he dutifully drops from the fireteam because we have made it that far, and we&#39;re feelin&#39; pretty good. That now leaves us with 5 guys. I&#39;ve never raided with only 5 guys before. We carefully do all those drops into the section leading up to Gorgon. In Gorgon, we skipped the chest, and let Rosey direct traffic to the leap of faith section before the Gatekeeper. This particular section is what I feared the most, as I&#39;ve seen good players bite it here frequently. Everyone goes 1 at a time so as to not cause any disruption to coordinating jumps. Rosey and I are the last guys to go, we ask who wants to go last. We both say that we don&#39;t want to be the last one to go, as there&#39;s obviously a bit of pressure when you&#39;re the final guy, and everyone&#39;s made it. But like an exemplary leader and veteran, he says you go. I make my attempt and in cinematic fashion I make the leap but not without a moment of panic, as my shield busts upon landing. I cross the ledge and by the time Rosey &amp; I go to the Gatekeeper door, we all agree that taking a bathroom break, and a few minutes as a breather is a wise decision. Try to calm the nerves a bit. From this point on, everything went relatively smooth. We assigned vets to the take on the portals, and we were all met with success.</p>\n\n<p>I normally don&#39;t get involved with the first portal section as I don&#39;t fully have it down pat. Let the big boys handle that job. Next thing you know, that music comes through and Atheon is about ready to spawn. We are all getting the jitters, but no one has jynxed us by saying &quot;imagine we do it&quot; or whatever. We keep doing what our thing, Rosey took the first relic run on Mars, and that went well. The 2nd time through the portal and in the middle we played it conservatively and got out of the bubble before too much risk was involved staying there. the 3rd time in the portals I picked up the relic, and we had a close call in Mars. We got lucky not to have been sent to Venus at all, as you may know it can prove to be harder. On our way out, likeaboss says hold up before exiting cuz they had to eliminate the harpies outside the door. Once we got the green light I led us through, and sure enough as I&#39;m taking that leap into the middle I get zapped and yet again my shield was broken, but I still had a sliver left. We knew going through the portal this time it would potentially be our last, so everything had to go perfectly. After a few seconds in the relic bubble with weapons of light WE TOOK DOWN ATHEON, FLAWLESS RAIDER.</p>\n\n<p>Queue the utter disbelief that we achieved it so soon after setting out to make our attempts. Everyone thanked eachother for being involved, and I gave a personal round of thank yous to everyone, and shared an anecdote of how we came to make our acquaintance. The morale to get out of this story is that without Incapacities switching out, and Jdtinsley being a sport and dropping due to his curse glitch, this may not not have been possible! There are good samaritans out there in guardian and legendary form.</p>\n\n<p>It was so beautiful seeing that trophy pop on my screen. I only wish that I had recorded it, and that I had all the other trophys at the time, to get a double pop with platinum as a result.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today - I have one trophy left to get which is the Titan Class one. Got 3.5 upgrades left to do. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading my story. I really felt that I had to share it to honour my fell guardians, and to inspire greatness out of those yet to achieve. Only now, do I truly feel legend.</p>\n\n<p>[img]<a href=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/fmi3yx.jpg%5B/img%5D\">http://i58.tinypic.com/fmi3yx.jpg[/img]</a></p>\n\n<p>Infernal Hails</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Flawless raider run with a select bunch of guardians that are now trusted friends. once we were 6, but we became 5 due to a glitch. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
