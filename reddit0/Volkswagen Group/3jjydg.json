I go to pull in but a lady has her passenger door open, blocking the spot.  I inch closer hoping she would get the hint, but didn't. I rolled down the window and asked her politely to close her door so I could park. She glared at me and started fiddling on her phone again. \n\nI pulled my tiny car into the space, right so my front bumper was blocking her door from shutting and still managed to fill fully in the space. Got out, and went to work. She had to eventually pull her car up onto the sidewalk to close the door and get out.",
