Well now toyota/scion has released an updated TSB on the issue with new  part numbers (aka not just replacing the faulty hp pump with a new and equally faulty hp pump), see details below:</p>\n\n<p>Taken from ft86club.com cricket thread:</p>\n\n<p>TSB S-SB-0023-12 has a new revision (See bottom of post for link to download it), revision two released on 17 OCT 13 - for chirping. Old pump part number was\nSU 003-00328\nNew part number\nSU 003-05176. </p>\n\n<p>My advice to you is to find the updated TSB to download yourself (revision 2 published on 17 OCT 13, please don&#39;t be an idiot and find the old one from 2012). Print it out and hand it to the tech at the dealership. If you can&#39;t find it you might be able to request your dealership to do it for you but then you run the risk of them saying no you&#39;re wrong (a lie) to get you to go away. Unfortunately I have not been able to find an updated TSB to download for you guys, just the one for BRZs which I&#39;ve already made a post about somewhere but I wanted to make this all inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>BRZ TSB 09-54-12R: See edit below for newest update!</p>\n\n<p>Good luck! Post results here if you guys give this a shot.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanks to <a href=\"/u/thomo16\">u/thomo16</a> we have this updated Subaru TSB found here: <a href=\"http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1308012&amp;postcount=3198\">http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1308012&amp;postcount=3198</a></p>\n\n<p>Another Update: ft86 user 5AD86D stated: &quot;The revised TSB is abit funky. I was trying to pull it up and post it here today, yet thru the parts departments TIS services, only the old version 1 TSB would show. I had to go thru a service adviser just to get what he had showing MY vehicle was even applicable this time. It even stated on the paper he printed for me that SOME 2014 vehicles would apply to the TSB yet I couldn&#39;t find the latest version with the latest updated production ranges anywhere. Per what I was reading...it stopped at the VIN I last posted here, yet many vehicles past that production have the same chirp issue.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In short: the new revision is not showing up in everyone&#39;s TIS. He had to get a service adviser to look it up for him.</p>\n\n<p>Update 3: Download your copy of the revised TSB here: <a href=\"http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1311572&amp;postcount=3216\">http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1311572&amp;postcount=3216</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
