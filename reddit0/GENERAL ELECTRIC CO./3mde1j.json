  "selftext": "So I'm a Computer Engineering Student and am determined to try and work for GE. I asked this question over at r/engineeringstudents, but thought you guys already in the industry would have a much better answer for me. I should be interviewing with GE Appliances soon for a co-op (they are going to have an information session soon also) and I'm already signed up for an interview. The problem is that they are going to probably be sold into Electrolux by the time I get in. I was told two things: I'll either get in the GE system before then but be an electrolux co-op, or won't be associated with GE at all before I even get in. I was looking forward to it for the hardware/software practice, but I wasn't planning on staying with Appliances for longer than the co-op. Now that they're being bought by an appliance company (good for the appliance division, I'm sure they're happy about it), I won't have that flexibility to go to another GE division. I also heard, working for Appliances, it's pretty hard to get toanother division regardless, how true is that?\n\nPoint is, should I just try to join ITLP (they seemed interested) to get a foot into GE despite using no Computer engineering for a summer and doing IT and skip out on GE Appliances? Or should I go for Appliances, get some actual computer engineering experience in software/hardware but have the possibility of not getting into a GE summer internship in the end? Basically I'm asking, do you think the company will care for more experience in actual skills or having an \"in\" in the company? Thanks guys!",
