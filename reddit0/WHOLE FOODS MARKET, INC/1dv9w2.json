I love Hana Japanese Market on 17th and U, and the many hispanic stores in Columbia Heights/ Mt. Pleasant. But all the best Indian and Chinese stores appear to be outside of DC, in Rockville or Northern VA. Anyone know of metro-accessible ethnic markets within the city? Any ethnicity (Indian, Chinese, Korean, Italian, Ethiopian, all are welcome!) as long as it's not a major grocery store or chain.  ",
