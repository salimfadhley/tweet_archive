  "selftext": "No, absolutely not. Yes, our DPS fleet is now sitting in Eagles. Yes, a lot of us have cap alts. Yes, most of us know what we're doing in a stratop fleet.\n\nNO, we will never abandon the \"newbies\" part of our name. It's not just part of our name, it's our culture. It's what this alliance was founded on. I appreciate all our cap pilots, all our JF pilots, all our awesome FCs. The most important part of our alliance, of our culture, is the newbros.\n\nNewbros are the future. We were all newbros once. We will always accept newbros. We don't accept newbros because we love wagging our 150 man maulus fleet in PL's faces (though that is pretty awesome) we accept newbros so that we can nurture, teach them, and help them grow. Bringing up newbros, teaching them the game, and making sure they have fun with the game is the greatest thing BRAVE has achieved in this game.\n\nPL can burn our ships, and our sov to the ground. Catch is not brave. Eagle fleets, are not Brave. Capital fleets are not Brave. As long as we are showing newbros a good time, teaching them how to enjoy the game, and having fun doing it: that is Brave.\n\nI appreciate all the FC's, all the cap pilots, all the bittervets who make this corp awesome. But never forget about the newbros. Never forget to help out some newbros. Never forget to take a minute out of your ship spinning to answer some newbro questions in the Dojo.\n\nNewbros: If you have a question, are having problems, are feeling discouraged, want to know anything about the game, join the  Brave Dojo chat channel. No question is stupid (except for when I'm drunk and asking what time McDonalds breakfast opens.) Bittervets, or even you guys who have been in corp a month, keep the dojo channel open. Answering a couple questions while you're spinning your ship is an excellent use of your time.\n\nI strongly believe that our newbro culture is the most important thing of what our alliance has going on right now. We are the best new-player-experience in the game right now, and we should never forget that.\n\nAlso: If you guys talk down to newbros, try to scam a newbro, or don't keep it classy in the dojo channel, that Caligula fellow *will* dismember you.",
