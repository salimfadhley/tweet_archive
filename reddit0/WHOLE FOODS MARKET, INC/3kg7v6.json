  "selftext": "I'm 25 year old male, and I always considered myself an environmentalist, but growing up in rural Kentucky, hunting and fishing was a part of daily life. My wife thinks I'm her Ron Swanson. I've also always been a fan of documentaries, and after watching Food, Inc. I told myself that I would start buying local grass fed meat and local produce at the farmer's market. Well, the farmer's market is only open for a few hours on Saturday morning and it was in the middle of downtown. It just wasn't convenient, so I kept on shopping at Wal-Mart. I didn't buy notorious brands like Tyson, and thought I was doing my part.\n\nThen one day, during a magical trip I hadn't been on in years I experienced what is called \"ego-death\". I realized that I was part of the universe, and I saw my behavior objectively for the first time. I began to look into /r/Buddhism and I suddenly felt like everything I experienced made sense. The morals it teaches were how I've been feeling inside my entire life. I saw how how I can reduce suffering in my own life, and the world. Then I began to look into /r/vegan. I saw Earthlings in the sidebar so last week while playing on my PC, I decided to watch Earthlings in the background. I kept watching, and I kept watching, and very soon I stopped playing. It was hard to watch, but I forced myself to witness the brutality and horror that happens on farms. I finished the movie very upset, crying, and sick to my stomach. I knew right then, that everything was wrong. I love cooking and exercising, so meat protein and whey protein were my lifeblood. After watching that documentary I was drowning with guilt about how recklessly I was consuming animal products. I told my wife that I was switching to a vegan diet, and she snapped at me. She thought I was having some psychological crisis, because how could I eat meat for 25 years and then suddenly change in one night? She refused to talk to me for a couple days because she thought I was losing my mind and I was trying to force her to change her whole lifestyle. I finally had a long talk with her about how this a personal choice, and how I've had these feelings for a long while. She relaxed and offered to pick me up some vegan foods from the grocery store. Then came the ridicule from family and friends who know I'm usually the typical \"masculine carnivore\". Their comments were mostly like \"you won't make a difference\" and \"it's the circle of life\". I just finished Cowspiracy, and I knew how disconnected environmentalism had become from reality. I told them how meat-eating is unsustainable with 7 billion people. I told them I'm part of the world and if I can change myself I can change the world. I told them I want to live longer, and maybe help the planet live longer too. Some people accepted it, others did not. I don't care though, because I found inner peace and I wouldn't trade that for anything. Thank you /r/buddhism and /r/vegan for putting my on the path towards enlightenment. So far, I'm loving being vegan. It's not just good for the body and the planet, it's good for the soul.\n\nedit: I want to thank you all for the advice and support you've given me. It really touches my heart.",
