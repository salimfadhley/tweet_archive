  "selftext": "We have picked up additional work for an existing client and we need a large number of utility line locators to be able to start training on March 3. For those not familiar with the utility industry, a line locator responds to tickets generated by the Miss Utility/Call before you dig/811 system.  If you like working without close supervision and being outdoors, this could be the right job for you.\n\nSome more information about the job and what the company does can be found [here](http://www.heathus.com/tasks/sites/_hc/assets/File/recruiting_brochure.pdf) and [here](http://www.heathus.com/_hc/index.cfm/about-us/history/).  A video that has both a brief company history and some video of technicians working can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n85-ieUEG-U), although it is mainly talking about leak survey instead of locating.  There is also an interview with the president of the company [here](http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/third-generation-president-directs-heath-consultants%E2%80%99-discoveries).\n\nThe job is pretty much completely outdoors.  A take home company vehicle is provided as well as a gas and maintenance card (no personal use allowed however).  You will receive tickets through a dispatching system that will give you the address of the locate request as well as the scope of the area to be marked.  The contract is for only natural gas, so you will be responsible for only locating that utility on each ticket.  You will use equipment provided by Heath to perform the locate and once the marking with paint and/or flags is complete you will close the ticket in the computer and then move on to the next one.\n\nThis is a full-time position with required overtime.  There will be an on-call rotation in which you will be responsible for emergency locates that come in after normal working hours.  \n\n* Pay starts at 12.50/hr. if you have no experience.  Pay for experienced locators is based on experience level.  \n* Training is fully paid and will start on March 3.  \n* Paychecks are weekly.\n* Must have the ability to pass a physical and drug test at company expense.  \n* Must be able to meet the following criteria for the background and DMV screen:  No felonies in the past seven years and no more than 2 moving violations in the past three years.  Felonies older than 7 years will be looked at on a case by case basis and misdemeanors may require more information but will not generally be disqualifying.\n* You must possess at least basic map reading skills as you will have to use as-built drawings, service cards, and maps provided by the client to complete the locate in some cases.\n* Decent social and communication skills are also important as you will occasionally have to coordinate with the contractors performing the excavations.  \n* Safety is paramount.  You must be willing to follow safety policies and procedures as well as wear all required PPE.\n* Attention to detail is extremely important.  The lines must be marked as accurately as possible to prevent them from being struck and possibly endangering life and property.\n\nIf you are interested, you can reply ITT or PM me.  Please ask questions ITT so others can see the answers.  I will try to keep up as best as I can.  You can get an application [here](http://www.heathus.com/tasks/sites/_hc/assets/File/div43_application.pdf).  Once you have it filled out, save it and PM me for the email address to send it to.  \n\nThank you for your interest and feel free to let anyone who may be interested know.\n\n**Edit - We are gathering applications and doing phone interviews from 2/17 to 2/22.  Face to face interviews will start being held the week of 2/24.**",
