Let me preface that I can be long-winded and that if you want to skip to the cigar facts I'd be okay with that.\n\n**Full Name:** John Pierpont \"JP\" Morgan\n\n**Date of Birth:** April 17, 1837\n\n**Date of Death:** March 31, 1913\n\n**Quick Biography:** \n\nKnown as Zeus of Wallstreet, JP Morgan was born with more than a silver spoon in his mouth. His great grandfather was a millionaire banker, and his father inherited his fortune. Junius Morgan, JP's father, was a prominent and respected banker in Europe, who quickly grew his fortune. Once JP graduated from school--high school in Boston, university at Gottingem, Germany, and between the two studied French and German in Switzerland--Junius had an opportunity to be the tie between bankers and investors of Europe and America. JP became this tie, working at Duncan, Sherman as an apprentice. Most of this was to connect the banking world of the States and Europe, but also he was sent because Junius was concerned about his son's love of beer and cigars (reminds me of a few of you guys). Once state-side, Morgan quickly grew in power. However, he also met a woman, Mrs. Amelia Sturges, and fell in love. Her early death, right after their marriage, sent him into a very deep depression, many of which believe he never really got out of. \n\nHowever, this also lead him to being quick and wise in deals, something that characterized his \"morganizing\" tactics for the rest of his life. He later remarried, but was known for many affairs on his many yachts. By 1870, he was making $75,000 (which is roughly $1.3M) every year, and by 1882 was making $500K every year. He had his hand in many, many deals ranging from gun restocking in the Civil War to building the Titanic to saving the stock market and even bailing out the US Government. As mentioned, JP Morgan financed and built the Titanic, using his company International Mercantile Marine, and was set to attend it's maiden voyage on the Suite B deck in 1912. However, JP was unable to make it to the maiden voyage, fortunately for him. The sinking and death of many people weighed very, very heavily on him, and many contribute the stress and depression to his death.\n\n**Major Accomplishments:**\n\n* Bailing out Wall Street in 1907, keeping the stock market from completely crashing and dying.\n\n* J.P. Morgan & Co. which continues to be one of, if not the, leader in banking and investing firms in the world today.\n\n* Saving the treasury in 1895 allowed the US to continue a Gold Standard while not defaulting on every loan they've made.\n\n* The New York Times was bought and re-vamped and made into what it is today by Morgan in 1896.\n\n* U.S. Steel was begun by Andrew Carnegie, but bought by Morgan in 1900 for a value of $1b.\n\n* General Electric Co. was founded by Morgan after financing Thomas Edison's lightbulb invention.\n\n**Cigar Facts:**\n\nMorgan was known for being a big cigar enthusiast. Unfortunately there's not as much data on his cigar-loving as there are people such as Babe Ruth, Castro, and others. Known for being an avid cigar smoker, he famously smoked an 8\" maduro Meridiana Kohinoor while contemplating bailing out Wall Street in 1907. His smoking habits and love of the leaf developed while studying in Germany. He was popular for his many nights at beer halls dancing and drinking and smoking his favorite sticks. This love continued his whole life, and on all of his yachts he had custom humidors built so that he could travel the world and relax with many stogies. Found on his yachts are specially designed cigar cutters and specialty bottles of scotch--no doubt paired with many a fine cigar. From estate auctions of his stuff, there are specialty silver humidors.\n\nIn 1895 when the government's gold began to fail, Morgan went down to Washington to speak with the President. Before talking, he spent all night smoking cigars and thinking of what to do.\n\nAmong his favorites, and staples in his yachts' humidors, are the Regalia de Morgans, Meridiana Selectos, and, of course, the Meridiana Kohinoors as mentioned earlier.\n\nAnd, lastly, my favorite cigar fact, and one that shows just how much of a BotL this man was. Ordered for Congressional Hearings, the shy, private man became very stressed and depressed. His health declined so much so, actually, that his doctor convinced him to cut his smoking down. Reluctantly, he agreed, promising to smoke no more than the low, low amount of *20 cigars every day*. This man would fit in very well here at /r/cigars.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Cigar Aficionado](http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/Zeus-of-Wall-Street-_6151)\n\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan#Career)\n\n* [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/04/27/jpmorgan.corsair.yacht.auction/)\n\n* [Boston Harbor Auctions](http://bostonharborauctions.com/news/2013/7/22/sunday-october-16-2011)\n\n* [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/12/magazine/the-mark-of-el-supremo.html)\n\n**For More Reading:** Other installments of BotLs in History can be found here:\n\n* [Babe Ruth](https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/3ehdka/botls_in_history_babe_ruth/) by /u/I_hearthistory\n\n* [Avellino Lara](https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/3ek49o/habanos_voices_of_the_past_avellino_lara/) by /u/beardofcastro \n\n* [Ulysses S Grant](https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/3ed089/botls_in_history_ulysses_s_grant/) by /u/I_hearthistory\n\n**Thank you for reading!!**",
