I pick up the phone, planning to put her on hold for about 30 seconds so I can finish up with the live customer in front of me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you for calling, can you hold for just a moment please?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;NO!  I need to talk to the reptile person NOW!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am the &#39;reptile&#39; person, but I&#39;m with another customer it&#39;ll be just a moment&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m already cringing.  I put her on hold as soon as I finish explaining I&#39;m with somebody, because I know people like this, and if I ask her to hold again, she&#39;ll just refuse.  So she gets put on hold for a little less than 30 seconds.  I finish bagging up my other customer&#39;s crickets and turn my attention back to the phone.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hello, how may I help you today&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I told you not to put me on hold&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I apologize, but I have to take care of the customers in the store first m&#39;am&quot;</p>\n\n<p>At this point she starts going off on me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, my lizard is DYING, he won&#39;t eat, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s drinking, and I NEED HELP and he could have DIED when you put me on hold!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, please slow down, can you tell me what kind of lizard?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He&#39;s a leopard gecko&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And when did you buy him from us?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t get him there, I got him at a reptile show&quot;</p>\n\n<p>(At this point, I could have just told her that it is not my responsibility, as she did not purchase it from our store.  But I can understand that she is under stress and trying to help this poor little lizard survive, so I&#39;m going to do my best to try and point her in the right direction.)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, I can tell you what we would do for our reptiles here if they seem to stop eating.&quot;  I go on to explain to her how you can sometimes open their mouth and get them started on a cricket, on using different supplements to make sure he&#39;s getting nutrition out of it.  But most importantly, I recommend to her that she go find a vet who deals with exotics.  If he&#39;s really looking that bad, she needs to take him to a professional.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;VE ALREADY TRIED TO! I tried putting a cricket in his mouth and he won&#39;t eat it!!! I don&#39;t WANT to pay for a vet bill!  He doesn&#39;t look good! What do I do???&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It sounds like you&#39;re doing all you can, the only other thing you can do for him is you need to take him to a vet.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I almost laughed out loud at what she said next.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I want to speak with your manager.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Please hold&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I put the phone on hold.<br/>\nOk.  I can be empathetic to a point.  I can understand that somebody might take their frustration out on me when something is wrong with the pet we sold them.  The problem is, we didn&#39;t sell her this gecko, and I am not a certified veterinarian...if he&#39;s really that bad, she needs to get off of the phone with me and CALL A DAMN VET.</p>\n\n<p>I told my manager the short version of the story and he picked up the phone and reiterated to her what I already had said.  </p>\n\n<p>According to him, she threatened to call corporate on us and hung up on him.  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what happened to her lizard, but I can only hope that she comes to her senses and takes him to a vet, but I highly doubt it.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
