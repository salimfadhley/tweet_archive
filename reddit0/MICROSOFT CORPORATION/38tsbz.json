  "selftext": "Alright, so I am utterly stumped. My PC crashes http://i.imgur.com/wQy5Wg3.png?1 everytime I play a game (mostly fullscreen games but other games are affected as well). Temps are fine and normal, no drivers crash, no blue screens, I've reinstalled, restored from restore point, the GPU isn't artifacting, fan noises are normal, I've reinstalled, restored from restore point, and refreshed the OS, drivers, and games. No luck. User benchmark and Furmark crash as soon as they start doing the graphical parts. Games crash as soon as they load. However some borderless games crash after around 3 minutes or so. So, I turn to you PCMR, and to sweeten the deal I will gift a $25 Steam card to the first person who can fix my problem. Good luck! Also, if you could be as kind to upvote so others can see that would be great. Thank you.\n\n\nEDIT: My parents thought it would be a good idea to go to Chicago, so I'll be away for a week. When I get back I will try out your suggestions and award the winner! I will try to respond when I can. Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for helping me! :)\n\n\n\nMINI DUMP: http://i.imgur.com/eASAeII.png?1\n\n\nMOST RECENT CRASH: http://i.imgur.com/T964wye.png?1\n\n\nMicrosoft (R) Windows Debugger Version 6.3.9600.17336 AMD64\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
