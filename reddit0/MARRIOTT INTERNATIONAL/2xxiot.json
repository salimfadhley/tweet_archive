  "selftext": "First and foremost, I do not hate children.  I have three of my own, and love them dearly.  I encourage and support charities, occasionally even religiously-affiliated ones, that cater to children's health.\n\nBut because I was curious about [Children's Miracle Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Miracle_Network_Hospitals) myself (after recently having [breakfast at IHOP](http://www.ihoppancakeday.com/about-childrens-miracle-network.html), natch), I read a bit about it.  The group was [founded](http://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/About) by the very Mormon [Osmond family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Osmonds), in conjunction with Duke boy and born-again Christian [John Schneider](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-schneider-christian-films-pro-life-dukes-hazzard-306023), along with Mormons Mick Shannon and Joe Lake.  \n\n[Mick Shannon](http://www.ksl.com/?sid=10675359), a BYU grad, later resigned as a local city councilman after he was charged with a felony of criminal mischief.  [\"Joe Lake\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=41LhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1171&lpg=PT1171&dq=%22joe+lake%22+mormon&source=bl&ots=BGaYdeeWm5&sig=ogi_CVUbqvPzCbXdH07vGeJMXts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JkL3VIvGGcjyoATfvILQCw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22joe%20lake%22%20mormon&f=false) is the name of a Mormon character in Zane Grey's western novel \"The Rainbow Trail\".\n\nThe current CEO is also a Mormon and a grad of BYU, [John Lauck](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-lauck/4/768/203) (the [previous CEO](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700259995/Childrens-Miracle-Network-CEO-accused-of-fraud.html?pg=all) was hit with multiple felony charges of fraud).  Their [chairman of the board](http://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/About/Board) is Steve Weisz, president of Marriott Vacation Club International.  The [Marriotts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Willard_Marriott) are among the most powerful Mormon families.  Children's Miracle Network's headquarters are located in Salt Lake City.\n\nNone of this is to say that Children's Miracle Network is a bad organization, and Charity Navigator gives the group a [high rating](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=5756).  I was just surprised by the clear Mormon ties to the group, given their strong support by other companies like IHOP, and thought I'd share the knowledge I picked up along the way.
