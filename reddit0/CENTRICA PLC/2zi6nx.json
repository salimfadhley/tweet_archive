The reasoning for the timing of these threads is threefold:\n\n- reddit locks threads after six months.\n- It wouldn't make sense to have roll calls for previous cruises.\n- It allows for plenty of time to connect with others.\n\nAll other future roll call threads will be deleted and the poster will be redirected to the correct thread. If a thread does not yet exist for the month of your embarkation, please remain patient.\n\nIn effort to make these changes effective immediately, this thread will not only serve as an announcement, it shall also serve as a mega thread for cruises embarking during months in which threads would have already existed had this have been done previously.\n\nWith that said, if you are **embarking** between today and August 31 (inclusively), feel free to share and find other redditors going on the same cruise.",
