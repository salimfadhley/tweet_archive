There\u2019s an App for That**\n*BMO Harris Bank initiative gives new meaning to \u2018smartphone withdrawal\u2019 in bid to cut fraud*\n\nBy \nRITA TRICHUR\nMarch 15, 2015 6:38 p.m. ET\n\nThe latest gambit by banks to reduce card fraud? Get rid of the card.\nChicago-based BMO Harris Bank, a unit of Canada\u2019s Bank of Montreal, on Monday will launch the U.S.\u2019s biggest cardless ATM network, allowing customers to withdraw cash by using their smartphones. The bank says the technology will speed up transactions and reduce fraud.\nThe move will give Bank of Montreal an early lead in one segment of the growing mobile-payments business in the U.S. The Canadian bank\u2019s push comes as lenders seek to cut costs and bolster security as customers increasingly use smartphones to manage their finances. In the U.S., banks face heightened pressures to wring savings by pruning their branch networks while cutting down on card fraud.\nBMO Harris Bank says that to access cash without using a debit card, customers can prep a transaction before arriving at an ATM. To do this, they log onto a mobile-banking app on their smartphones, enter the amount to be withdrawn, walk up to an enabled ATM and press the mobile cash button. After the customer holds up the QR code on their smartphone to a reader, the ATM dispenses the requested cash.\nThe bank says a mobile cash transaction takes 15 seconds, compared with 45 seconds for a debit-card withdrawal, and is safer because the customer doesn\u2019t need to insert his or her card. That eliminates the possibility of \u201cskimming\u201d devices that allow fraudsters to pull information from a card\u2019s magnetic strip in a compromised ATM. Also, no card information is stored on the phone, and the bank can remotely delete the app if a device is lost or stolen.\nInformation passed between the phone and the ATM is encrypted. Once a withdrawal is complete, the transaction\u2019s metadata vanishes and can\u2019t be reused, the bank says. Customers who also use passwords or biometric fingerprint identification to access their smartphones benefit from an extra layer of security.\nBMO is rolling out the service first in the U.S. rather than in its Canadian home market because card security south of the border lags behind that of Canada.\n\u201cWe know that there have been instances in the past in the financial sector where there has been skimming,\u201d said Connie Stefankiewicz, head of North American Channel Strategy and Solutions at Bank of Montreal. \u201cCards get lost. Cards get stolen. PINs get skimmed. All of those things are actually mitigated by the use of the smartphone.\u201d\nGeneral-purpose debit, prepaid and ATM fraud totaled $1.7 billion in 2012 in the U.S., according to a 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study. The average fraudulent ATM cash withdrawal was $217.\nThe so-called mobile cash service initially will be available on 750 ATMs, increasing to 900 ATMs by June, the bank says. BMO Harris Bank, which is ranked No. 2 in both Illinois and Wisconsin by deposit market share\u2014behind J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and U.S. Bank National Association, respectively, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data\u2014has more than 2 million personal and commercial customers, 600 branches and more than 1,300 ATMs.\nPayments security has been a growing issue following data breaches at retailers such as Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that fraudsters were putting stolen credit-card data into Apple Inc. iPhones enabled with Apple Pay service.\nAlthough that could make some people leery about using mobile-based cash withdrawals, BMO says the service has added security features because a customer would need the login information for the app in addition to the password or fingerprint data for their own phone.\nIf a debit card is reported lost or stolen, BMO would deactivate the card.\nThe app won\u2019t accept stolen-card information. To thwart so-called phishing scams, the bank uses technology that is based on security questions and the \u201cdigital fingerprint\u201d of a customer\u2019s smartphone.\nIn many other countries, including BMO\u2019s home market of Canada, many people do their banking online or via smartphone apps. Checks, and increasingly cash, are falling out of favor with consumers due to the convenience and security of digital payments. The U.S., however, is a bit of an outlier, said Ms. Stefankiewicz.\n\u201cThere is still quite a high usage of cash in the U.S. relative to Canada,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., people always have cash, I find. It is just a different approach.\u201d\nCash may be king in the U.S., but the growing popularity of app-based payments could eventually pose a competitive threat to BMO\u2019s mobile cash service.\nOther U.S. banks are also offering cardless ATMs. Rosemont, Ill.-based Wintrust Financial Corp., which operates in the Chicago area and southern Wisconsin, offers the service on its entire fleet of 195 ATMs. It began rolling out the service last August.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to skim the card,\u201d said Tom Ormseth, head of digital channels for Wintrust. \u201cThey don\u2019t just have to do it at the walk-up ATMs, you can also use it at the drive-through.\u201d\nLos Angeles-based City National Corp., which is being acquired by Royal Bank of Canada, completed a test of cardless ATMs in July 2014. The company doesn\u2019t have immediate plans to expand the program, said Cary Walker, senior vice president of corporate communications, in an email.\nBMO Harris Bank will also open its first \u201csmart branch\u201d\u2014effectively a teller-less location\u2014in Chicago on Monday. The branch will house ATMs that allow customers to communicate with remote tellers via video conference\u2014a move that it says will eventually facilitate round-the-clock branch banking. Another four smart branches are in the works for this year, mostly in the Chicago area.\nThe model will allow customers to use video tellers to conduct basic transactions, including deposits, withdrawals and bill payments.\n",
