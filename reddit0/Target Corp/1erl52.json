We've taken on two new members in the last week or so, each of these new members is a brand-new character that joined our corp within 48 hours of joining EvE, and this makes me suspicious. \n\nAfter the first newb joined, I talked to our CEO about it and long story short he claims he does a background check on all new members, even myself. \"But don't you need an API key? I never gave you one\", I said. \"Nah, there are ways to do that without one.\"\n\nSo, a few questions:\n\n* Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't do much checking at all without an API key, right? Check character info, corp history, maybe an Internet/EvE forum search, but that's about it, right? I think my CEO is either lying about having done anything, or bluffing about how much he was able to do.\n* Is it common for true newbs to join a corp so soon after getting online? This circumstance alone is the source of most of my suspicion. The pattern of one person joining so quickly, and then another doing the same some days later strikes me as a scout finding a good target corp (Orcas make good KM) and then bringing his friend on board a few days later.\n* I'm something of an IRL security hawk and all-around paranoid person. Any tips on convincing my CEO on the need for API BG checks for new members? Introduce him to the fine tales of the Belligerent Undesirables, maybe, and tell him \"this could be us if we don't protect ourselves\"? \n\nThanks in advance, all!\n\n",
