It was during this phase that I ended up in a poorly staffed department - basically, it was me and the system expert. Being the lowly PFY, it fell to me to carry out most of the simple day-to-day work, like cleaning the air filters, collecting the buckets of steam, taste-testing the active wires, picking up a long weight from the stores department, and turning the systems on first thing on a Monday morning.</p>\n\n<p>This was an unusual system, in that it was legacy equipment (cutting edge technology!)<sup><sup><sup>of</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>the</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>1940s...</sup></sup></sup> using synchro transmitters and receivers - the important receivers being in a different building altogether, hundreds of meters away. However, some intelligent person had split the output to a bank of local receivers, so we could see that the transmitters and receivers were working correctly, without having to run all over the site.</p>\n\n<p>So on this fateful morning, I powered up the equipment and everything looked good, right up until I got to checking the synchro receiver readings. One of the receivers was spinning constantly, and as the PFY, I had <em>no idea</em> what to do about it.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the panel and checked the connections; everything looked tight and clean (the synchro receivers generated carbon dust like crazy, we cleaned them fortnightly <em>(or biweekly, if you prefer that terminology)</em>). Having exhausted my (admittedly limited PFY) options, I called the system expert (SE):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ME: SE! Man, I&#39;m freaking out here. One of the synchro receivers is just constantly spinning.</p>\n\n<p>SE: Just calm down, man. Is it all the synchros or just one?</p>\n\n<p>ME: Just one.</p>\n\n<p>SE: Is it only the local one, or is the remote doing it too?</p>\n\n<p>ME: Just the local one - the remote is okay.</p>\n\n<p>SE: OH! Is it the third one from the top?</p>\n\n<p>ME: Yeah! I opened up the panel to check the connections, but they look OK.</p>\n\n<p>SE: Okay, here&#39;s what you do... Close the panel door, and do the screws up tight. Now, in the center of the panel is a ventilation grill. Do you see it?</p>\n\n<p>ME: Yeah, I do.</p>\n\n<p>SE: Okay, take the index and middle fingers on your left hand, and place the left side of your middle finger against the right side of the ventilation grill.</p>\n\n<p>ME: <em>(I&#39;m not sure how this is going to help, but I&#39;m doing it)</em> Okaaaay...</p>\n\n<p>SE: Slide your fingers up until you&#39;re directly across from the third opening in the ventilation grill.</p>\n\n<p>ME: I&#39;ve done that.</p>\n\n<p>SE: Just to the right of your index finger, you should see a very very faint pencil mark.</p>\n\n<p>ME: I see it - X marks the spot, right?</p>\n\n<p>SE: That&#39;s the one! Now - and this is important - take your left hand away from the panel. Is it down?</p>\n\n<p>ME: Yeah...</p>\n\n<p>SE: Now, raise your right hand above your head, and bring the palm of your hand down on that X as hard as you can.</p>\n\n<p>ME: Um... what?</p>\n\n<p>SE: Trust me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I hit that panel, and pretty hard too.

Over time, the metal tongue in one relay had become sticky (for lack of a better term). As the relay never clicked into place, the receiver never got its reference voltage, so it would just spin continuously. The vibration from hitting the panel in just that spot was just enough to shake the tongue loose and allow the magnetic field to do it&#39;s job, activating the relay and allowing it to pass the reference voltage to the receiver, causing the synchro receiver to rapidly rotate to it&#39;s correct position.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the age of the equipment, official spares were not available, and due to company policy, we were not permitted to install unofficial spares.
