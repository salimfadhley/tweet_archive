Here is proof that this is me: https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson \nI've been referred to as the 'most fiscally conservative Governor' in the country, and vetoed so many bills during my tenure that I earned the nickname \"Governor Veto.\" I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, and believe that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology. Like many Americans, I am fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. I'm also an avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist. I have currently reached the highest peak on five of the seven continents, including Mt. Everest and, most recently, Aconcagua in South America.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION You can also follow me on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and Tumblr.\n ",
