Core earnings per share (EPS) are now expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, compared to a prior range of $0.79 to $0.85. All-in diluted net earnings per share, which includes a gain of $0.47 to $0.50 on the sale of the Snacks business, are expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.26 per share, compared to a prior range of $1.21 to $1.32. The revisions to the Company's fourth quarter 2012 outlook are primarily driven by slower than anticipated top-line growth from slower than expected market growth rates and market share softness in developed regions and negative impacts from foreign exchange rate changes. For fiscal 2013, it expects organic sales to increase in the range of 2%-4%, core EPS to be in-line to up mid-single digits percentage versus fiscal 2012 results. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, core EPS outlook equates to approximately mid-to-high single digit growth.",
