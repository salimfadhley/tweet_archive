I've been lucky enough to have my parents contribute to my Roth IRA while I was still in school and has been a great learning experience for me. Being at such a young age, I feel that I have a greater tolerance for risk and that is why you can see some of my investments may be on the riskier side. I have been contemplating getting rid of some NFLX since it is such a large part of my portfolio now. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions to help me invest for the future. I have been contemplating getting out of MSFT and T because they don't have much growth potential and I feel I could put it into something else.\n\nEDIT: Welp I figure that would format better into columns.
