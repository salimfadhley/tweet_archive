Maybe less well known is the lifestyle of employees below your feet. \n\nAsk me anything.\n\n*Alright guys this has been a blast. Unfortunately I'm getting on a ferry and will soon be out of service area. If you'd like, keep submitting questions and I'll answer as many as I can later when I'm back in civilisation. \n\nThanks again. Didn't realise there'd be so much interest in the chaos that is my career. Cheers!",
