I couldn&#39;t find anything that stated whether a breast pump was covered or excluded, so I called our insurance co&#39;s pre-authorization line to inquire. I was told on July 22nd that yes our coverage would cover 80% of the cost of &#39;medical grade&#39; breast pumps, and was given the contact information of a company out of Milwaukee that provides various medical apparatus and has a contract with our insurance company. </p>\n\n<p>I call the Milwaukee company and they give me a list of what they deem to be &#39;medical grade&#39; breast pumps, so the wife and I spend an evening reading reviews of the various pumps online. We settle on a pump and contact the Milwaukee company about purchasing it. We gave the company our insurance information and received a call about an hour later confirming that our insurance company would cover 80% of the pump we selected. We order the pump and get it about a week later (roughly August 1).</p>\n\n<p>This morning, we get a bill from the Milwaukee company for a little over $700.00, stating that our insurance company denied the claim and that we now owe the full amount. I got on the Medela website, and the MSRP for the goddamn thing is $374.99, and I can find it brand new on Amazon for $295.00 shipped. I call the Milwaukee company and raise a bit of hell, and they said they would give me a PPO discount that knocks the price down to $404.00, but they submitted the claim to my insurance company on September 2nd (a full month after we placed the order and received the pump) and it was denied. </p>\n\n<p>I call my insurance company and raise a bit more hell about why our claim was denied, and was told that that my insurance policy does not cover breast pumps. I ask them to see if there&#39;s any way to verify whether or not I made the phone call at the end of August, and I get a call back from a representative that they can verify I called, that I did in fact inquire about whether I have coverage for a breast pump, that they did in fact direct to the Milwaukee company, but that they can neither confirm nor deny whether I was told a &#39;medical grade&#39; pump would be covered. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m at a complete loss as to what I should do. I would have never even known about this Milwaukee company had I not been directed there by my insurance provider, and now I&#39;m stuck with a $400.00+ bill for a product that I would have spent $300 on had I never contacted my insurance company. This comes after spending the better part of a weekend arguing with the insurance provider over our alleged failure to get pre-authorization for the OXYGEN my wife was put on when she went in for an emergency caesarian (which raises another question - why in God&#39;s name is 20 minutes of O2 an $880 charge?)</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the rant, it&#39;s been a long day </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
