Opioid therapeutics generally fall into two classes: codeines, which include oxycodones and hydrocodones, and morphines. Zohydro ER is a hydrocodone, the most commonly prescribed opioid in the United States, and Zohydro ER competes with therapeutics within both the codeine and morphine classes. These therapeutics include both Schedule II and Schedule III products (meaning that they are considered controlled substances by the DEA) being marketed by companies such as Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt Inc., Pfizer, Purdue Pharma L.P., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Actavis, Inc. On February 27, 2014, the DEA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to reschedule hydrocodone combination products from Schedule III to Schedule II, but we cannot predict the timeframe in which the rule may become final and when, if ever, these products will be required to comply with Schedule II requirements. Zohydro ER is already a Schedule II product.\n\n\n* In April 2014, Purdue Pharma L.P. announced that it filed an NDA for its extended-release hydrocodone product candidate that is formulated to incorporate abuse deterrent properties, which was accepted by the FDA in July 2014 for a priority review. In addition, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited recently announced that it plans to submit an NDA by the end of 2014 for its extended-release hydrocodone product candidate that is also formulated to incorporate abuse deterrent properties. Approval of these product candidates or any abuse-deterrent formulation of hydrocodone may drive further negative publicity and political action, or even result in the FDA revoking its approval of our NDA for Zohydro ER. While we do not believe that the FDA will revoke its Zohydro ER approval, and, in any event, the FDA would have to provide us with notice and opportunity for a hearing first, the related negative publicity, political influences and actions by our competitors could negatively affect our ability to market Zohydro ER and any opioid analgesic product candidates for which we may seek approval in the future. If the FDA did revoke its approval of Zohydro ER, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\n\nPositives\n---\n\n* (From 8K filing, regarding exclusivity) On August 13, 2014, Zogenix, Inc. (\"Zogenix\") received a paragraph IV certification from Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc.

Zogenix and its licensor are evaluating the paragraph IV certification and intend to vigorously enforce the intellectual property rights relating to Zohydro ER.\n\n* Zohydro ER was granted exclusivity by the FDA through October 2016; Zogenix plans to submit a supplemental New Drug Application for the next-generation capsule formulation of Zohydro ER by October 2014.\n\n* The parties have 45 days from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification to commence a patent infringement lawsuit against Actavis that would automatically stay, or bar, the FDA from approving Actavis's ANDA for 30 months or until a district court decision that is adverse to the asserted patents, whichever is earlier.\n\n--- \n\n* From this past quarter, net income was about $62.8 million (resulting from a deal that they were paid millions in cash, and more to come).

We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for at least the next year primarily as a result of our efforts to commercialize Zohydro ER, the clinical development for Relday, required post-market testing for Zohydro ER, safe use initiatives for Zohydro ER and additional development activities with respect to Zohydro ER, including the development of abuse deterrent formulations. As of June 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $81.2 million .\n\nPotentials\n---\n\n* They have Zohydro ER that they are aggressively fighting to ensure their success in legal standings (FDA approval, etc) and marketing ability (exclusivity,etc). \n\n* Another drug in the pipeline for schizophrenia called Relday.

I've posted the above points that I'm looking at and considering.
