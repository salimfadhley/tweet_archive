  "selftext": "Well, here I was today, all excited about getting my new Kayfun 4 SS Black edition. It's a great tank, even though I was overwhelmed by the mechanisms inside of it, which are surprisingly many. \n\nI took the thing apart and dipped everything in a spirit solution, after cleaning each part with soap and water. \n\nEventually, I brought everything back together, made a ni200 build and got the tank ready for usage. Everything started to fit into place and I even managed to set my airflow as I want it after numerous attempts. \n\nBut there was this strange wobble, and I remember watching a video about it and how to fix it. Well, I decided that I'll take the tank apart again and screw this piece harder, which was supposedly going to fix my tank. Unfortunately, while taking it apart I forgot to take the juice out, or more like I thought I was going to be able to do that after unscrewing the bottom part, like I can with my KF Lite. \n\nWell, stupid me got everything covered in juice in no time, so I rushed to the bathroom in order to clean up before it gets messier. I had to unscrew the top part of the tank a bit more, and of course, while doing that the Counter-nut fell off into the drain. The running water made sure that it got deep into the pipes, so I couldn't do anything to get it back.\n\nNow I have a brand new, unusable Kayfun 4 sitting here. :( You'd think I'll learn my lesson! I already lost a few screws and o-rings like this, but this part... it's too essential this time.\n\nOh well. I ordered 3 of these nuts from Fasttech. I'll be able to use the tank in a month, or two. Who am I kidding, like I'll ever learn my lesson. I'll just keep losing parts and ordering. Q_Q\n\n/rant over\n\n*TL;DR: Dropped my KF4 counter-nut into the sink, couldn't get it back - now brand new tank is unusable until spare part arrives.*\n\nedit: Using it with the plastic tube, as /u/egan_ has suggested :) Not such a bad cakeday after all!",
