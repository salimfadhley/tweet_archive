Its generic name is alprazolam.\n\nThe lead defendant is Jeremy Donagal, 35, of Martinez, whose nickname is allegedly \"Xanax King,\" according to the indictment.\n\nHe is charged with all 11 of the counts, including two counts of conspiring to manufacture alprazolam and other controlled drugs, one count of manufacturing such drugs, two counts of intending to sell alprazolam, and one count of selling counterfeit alprazolam tablets stamped with a phony Pfizer trademark.\n\nDonagal is also accused of two counts of international money laundering related to wire transfers of cash to China and three counts of structuring the Western Union transfers in amounts of less than $3,000 to avoid a federal reporting requirement.\n\nDonagal pleaded not guilty to the charges before U.S. Magistrate Donna Ryu, who ordered him held in custody while awaiting a detention hearing on June 5. Seven of the other defendants also face some of the drug charges and in some cases money laundering counts as well.\n\nThe ninth defendant, Alicia Mitts, 30, is accused only of the structuring counts. Ryu granted her release on $50,000 bail today while awaiting trial.\n\nThe magistrate ordered four others who were arrested Wednesday to remain in custody while awaiting future detention hearings.\n\nThey are Laurence Lindberg, 42; Thomas Elliott, 39; Michael Tomada, 42; and Christopher Neely, whose age was not given.\n\nHaag said one other defendant, Kenneth Koskiniemi, 37, was arrested in Fresno and appeared in federal court there Wednesday afternoon.\n\nDuston Kirk, 38, is a fugitive and defendant Michael Gonzalez, 41, is in state custody on another charge, Haag said.\n         \n--Bay City News",
