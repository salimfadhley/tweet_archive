Additionally, they are trying to sell me on Credit Cards, investments and everything that is not a checking account. Not interested in all that, just a joint checking!!!! Anyways, I don't think I want to go with Bank of America either.... Looking for another local option...Any suggestions?? Thank you so much!",
