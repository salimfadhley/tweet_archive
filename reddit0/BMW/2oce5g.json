  "selftext": "I am going to try my best to explain everything that's been going on with my situation. Let me start from the beginning. 4 months ago I made this account to get peoples opinions on whether or not i should order manual. Even though I was leaning toward manual, the automatic had some pros (better gas mileage, faster shifts, and I thought the auto-start stop feature only worked for automatic since this is what my salesperson told me).\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/2b45ei/going_to_order_the_bmw_m235i_cant_decide_between/\n\nSo I decided on a manual and to include the moonroof. I let my salesperson know through text.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/jOJlxwD\n\nShe told me she would email me the build list, since i did not recieve one i took the liberty of emailing her my build list just to be sure it was correct.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dofRT2Y.png\n\nshe also told me when a manual M235i came in and offered me a chance to go test drive it, which i took. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XFsCMip.png\n\na little over 2 months before my car is set to arrive, a lady runs a red light and hits my car (she was going about 60). My car catches fire about a minute later and it is completely totaled.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/vfiNjhs,6uAAhYx,wvjc0Gw#2\n\nhttp://imgur.com/vfiNjhs,6uAAhYx,wvjc0Gw#0\n\nhttp://imgur.com/vfiNjhs,6uAAhYx,wvjc0Gw#1\n\ncar on fire video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJw0020bvAw&feature=youtu.be\n\nso i am now car less and having to ask friends and family for rides everywhere. On top of that im in a cast and having to go to therapy 3 times a week.\n\nFast forward to my pickup date. I arrive to come get the car and my sister makes a comment \"that looks like automatic.\" I tell her no I ordered manual. This is when my salesman looks at me and says \"no you ordered automatic, remember i told you to let me know the next day\" [ in reference to when i first saw her]. I showed her the text and she just went quiet. So i go inside and take a seat while they are cleaning the car. I am thinking of what to do in this situation, so I ask my salesman if their is anything she can do about it not being manual. She says no. She says that the only option would be to order another one and wait 4 months, and i would lose the $1000 incentive and end up paying more. I ask her if i can have a loaner until my car comes, she says no. I even asked if I could just drive this until my car comes in, i was told no. she said she would apply some special coating to it though. at this point the only options i have are\n1) accept current car, order another one, wait 4 months, and end up paying more.\n2) refuse current car, order another one, wait 4 months, end up paying more, and be without a car for 4 more months.\n3) take the car and try to enjoy it even though its not exactly what I wanted.\n\nnow i know some of you are saying I messed up by accepting the car. Which i understand, that is my fault. But please understand my reasoning behind why i took the car. I don't want to have to keep getting rides from people for the next 4 months, and then on top of that end up paying more. But i loved my stickshift BMW. I've had it since i was 16. I love cars. the difference between a transmission is like a boy baby and a girl baby. We can't custom order a baby but I custom ordered my transmission to meet my standards. I really wanted to be okay with it being automatic, it would have made everything so much simpler. \n\nI was upset and just decided to vent on reddit.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/2m1xhr/so_my_m235i_came_in_today_in_automatic_even/\n\nI emailed her letting her know that I was not happy and i wanted to come talk to see what we could do about the situation. at this point i did not out the dealer because I wanted them to have a chance to make the situation right. They were not happy with me about the post. but now she is telling me I can drive the car and make the payments on it until my manual one comes in and i can swap it. HOWEVER, since it's 4 months down the line she cant tell me how much i will be paying since she doesn't know what the rates will be. I didn't feel this was fair. I asked her to just take back the car then but she said she could not, but she would talk to her manager. I even called corporate but they said they could not do anything and that I would have to talk to the dealer directly.\n\n\nreddit blew up unexpectedly. I had people telling me they called and complained to them as well as corporate. It definitely upset somebody because I was later emailed by corporate stating\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7qkb8xL.png\n\n\"Your request for assistance has been escalated to me. I am in the process of investigating your dealings with BMW of Monrovia. and that i would be notified about what will happen in 7-10 business days.\" I give him my emails/texts with bmw of monrovia. I later receive and email from BMW corporate stating \"Mr. Kassab-\nI have not heard back from the dealership regarding your scenario.\nI had left them a message last week for follow up. I will contact you when I do hear back from the dealership.\nKindly advise if you had any communication with them last week.\n \nKind regards,\nEd\"\n\nafter I tell him no I get another email from him yesterday and it said \"Mr. Kassab-\nThe Area manager indicated to me that Daniel from Monrovia was speaking to you?\n \nKind regards,\nEd\"\n\nthis is not true, and by now my sister tried talking to my salesman and after hearing a statement from her saying \"you act like this is my fault.\" My sister gets pissed and posts the dealerships name on my reddit post, at this point I figure since it's already out there and they haven't done anything to fix the situation, I put the name out their as well.not only has NO ONE FROM THE DEALER APOLOGIZED. they are now lying on top of that. I really wasn't trying to be difficult at all. I just wanted them to apologize and at least try to make things right with me.\n\nI've gotten so many messages from people trying to help and it really has been overwhelming. I want to thank everyone even those who have just been their for support. It means a lot. Even after all this, I will always love BMW cars. Even though I have been treated poorly by this dealership, BMW has been in my life since I was young, and I plan for BMW to be in my life as I grow older.\n\n\n***UPDATE 12/5/2014***\n\nDaniel just called me and said I can come in tomorrow to return the car and he will order a new one for me and provide me with a loaner. I was beginning to think this was a waste of time this is such a relief. It took a month but still it's finally getting settled, i honestly would've just accepted it if it wasn't for you guys. Thank you.\n\n***UPDATE 12/6/2014***\n\nso I went there to get everything settled. she definitely was not happy with me, told me \"I was messed up for what i did bashing them like that\". so i never did get an apology, which was disappointing, tried to make me out to be the bad guy, but it is what it is. Everything else got handled, got a 328i as a loaner, ordered new one M235i manual, she printed it out and had me sign it, not sure if that's the policy now or it was done to patronize me, either way much smarter of them. they took the car back. their going to check the car for damage on Monday, part of me feels like they might try to tell me i damaged the car to get back at me. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.\n",
