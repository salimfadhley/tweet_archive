  "selftext": "Good morning all,\n\nI picked up a used Cisco 800 series router a few weeks ago to begin learning the wonderful world of IOS and networking in general.\n\nI have this set up in my home lab and have successfully gotten it connected to my FIOS service via DHCP.  It has an IP address and I am able to get out to the internet from the Win 2K8 server and the Win 7 Desktop behind it.\n\nMy issue I am running into is that the speed of my connection took a massive hit when I swapped in this router and removed the pfsense box that was there before. Normally I was getting about 40mbps down and 35mbps up.  With the Cisco 871 I am getting about 8-9mbps down and about 1.5-2mbps up.  I don't know if I fudged the configuration of the device or if the device is bad.\n\nThis is the output of show version and show running-config:\n\n    158RT23Router>show ver\n    Cisco IOS Software, C870 Software (C870-ADVIPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.4(4)T7, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\n    Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\n    Copyright (c) 1986-2006 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\n    Compiled Wed 29-Nov-06 00:43 by kellythw\n     \n    ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 12.3(8r)YI4, RELEASE SOFTWARE\n     \n    158RT23Router uptime is 11 hours, 48 minutes\n    System returned to ROM by reload\n    System image file is \"flash:c870-advipservicesk9-mz.124-4.T7.bin\"\n    Last reload reason: Reload Command\n     \n     \n     \n    This product contains cryptographic features and is subject to United\n    States and local country laws governing import, export, transfer and\n    use.
