Doing as many others would, and did, do, I visited their website (http://www.tntacademy.com).  In fact, so much global traffic going to it actually exceeded the data limit of the hosting account, causing it to go offline for some time.\n\nAt first, I was surprised by the poor grammar for a place that was purported to be a school.  Looking beyond that, though, and actually reading the content, strong claims were made that did not appear to be either accurate, or seemed \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d so I dug further.\n\nBeginning with the FAQ, two read \u201cHow does the school work? and \u201cAre you accredited?\u201d  Under the first, it is clearly stated that the facility is a traditional school, as well as a non-traditional school offering credit recovery.  Under the second, it is stated that \"Yes, we are accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission, which is part of the University of Georgia.  By Spring 2015, The SACS  Accreditation will be completed to add to our growing list of accreditations.\u201d\n\nI see several problems with these claims:\n\n\u2022 TNT Academy does not have GAC recognition as a private school.  It is stated to be in preparation status (from the GAC Bulletin, \"PREP- Preparation does not mean accreditation, only that you are preparing for accreditation.\u201d)\nPastedGraphic-1.png\n\nHowever, it DOES have Accreditation with Quality as a NTEC:\nPastedGraphic-2.png\n\n\u2022 It is stated that the GAC is a part of the University of Georgia.  It is my understanding that the Georgia Accrediting Commission, Inc., is an independent entity, registered as a non-profit corporation in the State of Georgia, that is funded by the University of Georgia.\n\n\u2022 It is stated that TNT Academy (a for-profit corporation) will have \u201cSACS  Accreditation\u201d (sic) by the spring of 2015.  While there is no longer SACS accreditation as such, we can take this to mean accreditation by AdvancED\u00ae, yet a search of their list of accredited schools does not contain TNT Academy.\n\nIt is clear that TNT Academy, in several places on their site, is \u201crounding up\u201d their GAC accreditation as an NTEC to imply, if not expressly state, that they are an accredited school.\n\nAnother alarming thing noticed comes from the TNT Academy\u2019s listing of regular school hours (http://www.tntacademy.com/directions/) and academic calendar (http://www.tntacademy.com/pages/resources/media/2014_2015%20TNT%20Academic%20Calendar-2.pdf).  First, it is notable that the school is only open on Friday for the registration of new students and to receive payments.  Next, the daily hours are quite small, consisting of only five hours on three days a week, and three hours on a fourth.  This is an average of 18 hour per week, or 4.5 hours a day.  The State of Georgia, by law, requires a minimum of 5.5 hours of instruction a day for the day to be counted as an instructional day.  Furthermore, the school calendar shows only 138 days of instruction in the school year.  By law, the minimum number of school days in a year is 180.  The standards and legal requirements of this facility are not compliant with the provisions set forth in Title 20, Chapter 2, Article 6 of the Georgia Code.\n\nThe minimal level of instruction offered by TNT, and further false claims of accreditation status, is evidenced by an employment ad placed 14 days ago, which reads:\n> \tMath, Computer, Science, Middle School Teachers \n> \tTNT Academy - Lilburn, GA\n> \tNeed a variety of teachers for the 2015 - 2016. Some are full time some are part-time.\n> \tNeed to have a degree in the field you teach.\n> \tPart -time: Art, Computer, Foreign Language\n> \tFull time: Language Arts, Math, Chemistry, Physics\n> \t\n> \t1 to 3 days per week, flexible schedules, Great pay.\n> \tRetired teachers teachers of all types- come speak with us.\n> \tGeorgia Accredited and SACS Accredited\n \nThe false or misleading claims of TNT Academy continue.  They claim that 95% of their students continue on to college:\n> \tQ Do most of the graduates go to college?\n> \n> \tA Yes.  Fifty percent of the graduates stay in the metro Atlanta area going to colleges nearby-Kennesaw,GA. Perimeter, Gwinnett Technical, and\n> \tGeorgia Gwinnett. \n> \tTwenty-five percent of the graduates go out of state to attend colleges, such as Samford,Texas A & M,Wooster, Clemson, Auburn, and many others. \n> \n> \tTwenty percent of our graduates chose to attend and get hefty scholarships to UGA-Honors program, Emory, Agnes Scott, Georgia State,\n> \n> \tToccoa Falls,Piedmont and assorted others. \n> \n> \tThe remaining 5% have not yet decided what they want to do and are usually working a job of some kind when they graduate from high school.\n\nLooking at every online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of TNT Academy students available from indeed.com, of which there are 44, only eleven students pursued any college education.  25% is a far cry from 95%.\n\nI would solidly urge you to take a few minutes to review the TNT Academy website, and ask yourself if this appears to be a legitimate center for learning, or a diploma mill attempting to paint itself in a positive light.  With your backgrounds, you will find many more things than me, plebeian that I am.  While some things are simply humorous typographical errors (\u201cThe Dairy of Anne Frank\u201d) or amusing \u201cnew literary works\u201d resulting from poor grammar and organization, there are other items which are frightful.  To illustrate some of the unintended humor, I submit the following screen shot from http://www.tntacademy.com/courses/:\nPastedGraphic-1.png\nRemember, this is information from the website of a company claiming to offer a quality, accredited education, who claims \"AP American Lit/Composition and AP British Lit/Composition are available.\u201d\n\nRegarding your accreditation of TNT Academy as an NTEC, there are two points of compliance, namely  I and J that are not being met, prima facie.  Your requirements for operational hours and number of school days are not being met.  Now, I see that it is up to the NTEC to provide their written operational plan to verify their compliance, but they clearly aren\u2019t compliant, despite their affidavit to the contrary.\n\nThere have been numerous posts on online forums in recent days by former students, as well as allegations of grade-fixing by former teachers.  One student was asked:\n\"How large was the school? How many different teachers did you have teaching different subjects? People are saying that the school is a diploma mill, do you think this is true? What was the tuition like?\"\n\nThe student replied:\n\"It was pretty large, about 500 students or more. She was making A LOT of money doing this, each student was $300 a month.  There was little to no teaching, I just went there, got my work, went home, came back next week with the work done. She grades it and repeat, occasionally when a student needs help she'll explain it to them.\"\n\nThe student was also asked:\n\"What kind of image did Nancy Gordeuk [have] while you were still at school and did this incident come as a surprise for you?\u201d\n\nThe student replied:\n\"It didn't come as a surprise to me, I was shocked at the least. She doesn't think before she speaks...She got me from 6th grade to 10th grade in 2 years and I'm always going to be appreciative of that.  Heard her call people trifling, lazyass, halfasser, dumbass, smartass and generally asses.\"\n\nFrom these two answers, we can see that there is \u201clittle to no\u201d teaching at TNT, and that somehow, at least in this case, a student was able to somehow advance through school at twice the rate of a student in a traditional school.  I also find it troubling that a school of 500 students can somehow exist in a 5,000 square foot facility with just 17 parking spaces.\n\nAnother statement which brings alarm is this one:\n\"My mom worked here. She quit yesterday. This was the final straw for her. She knew something was going to blow up about this school but didn't realize this would be it. She's been fabricating grades and all sorts of stuff to get accredited. Another friend of my mom's quit last week, and another was fired last week after speaking up.\u201d\n\nYou can find each of these exchanges at reddit.com.  A place to find most relevant articles concerning TNT academy is http://www.reddit.com/r/TNTAcademy.\n\nAfter sharing these statements with an Atlanta reporter, I was told:\n\"I ended up [speaking to] a few students/parents since my last reply. Found former employees too, but they are not going on record just yet. However, they confirm your suspicions and worse.\"\n\nI urge you to review your relationship with TNT Academy; they clearly aren\u2019t playing by the rules, at the very least, and are willfully committing fraud, in my opinion, under O.C.G.A. 20-1-7.\n\nWhile I understand that your obligation extends solely to the degree to which you elect to enforce your standards of the awarding of accreditation, it is my firm belief that TNT Academy is operating fraudulently, inadequately, and in other ways contrary to the law.  I will bring my concerns directly to the Georgia Department of Education and to the State Attorney General; I understand that these issues are beyond the scope of your mission.  But, to the degree to which the conducting of operations at TNT are pertinent to you, I trust that you will investigate my concerns.  While I am not an interested party, that should have no bearing on whether or not you choose to look to see whether TNT is either unfairly using your accreditation to imply they are an accredited traditional school, or if they are operating contrary to their statement of compliance as evidenced by their inadequate number of hours and days of instruction.  As you very well know, any tolerance of the sub-standard lessens any real value of an accreditation by GAC to any legitimately accredited institution.\n",
