So far i&#39;ve been looking at what I could get for that price and i&#39;ve been eyeing a 2007-sh E class which seems like a good deal to me but what do I know, I&#39;m 16 and i&#39;ve never bought a car before. Anyway, thats not what this post is about, this post is to get tips from the Mercedes community on what would work, what wouldn&#39;t, what to look out for, what to expect and stuff like that. Any help is greatly appreciated! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
