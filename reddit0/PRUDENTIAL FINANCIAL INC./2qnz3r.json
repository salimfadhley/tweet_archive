  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\n  I posted this over on the Boglehead main site, but I didn't receive any responses, and didn't want to be a pest. Basically, my wife's company (a state hospital) notified us in November '14 they are closing the current 403B plan, and no future contributions will be allowed. So, I'm now in the process of rolling the funds over to a Vanguard Roth IRA. I myself actively contribute to a 401K through my employer, and the fund breakdown is as follows:\n\n**My 401K - plan with Principal Financial:**\n\n- Morley Financial Services, Inc. \u2013 Principal Stable Value Fund - .91%\n- PIMCO \u2013 PIMCO GNMA A Fund - .91%\n- Principal Global Investors \u2013 Bond and Mortgage Sep Acct - .71%\n- Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Separate Account - .79%\n- Principal LifeTime 2010 Separate Account - .83%\n- Principal LifeTime 2020 Separate Account - .87%\n- Principal LifeTime 2030 Separate Account - .91%\n- Principal LifeTime 2040 Separate Account - .94%\n- Principal LifeTime 2050 Separate Account - .94% (this is currently where 100% of my contributions are going)\n- Vanguard Group \u2013 Vanguard STAR Fund - .34%\n- American Century Inv. Mgmt. \u2013 American Century Value Inv Fund - 1.00%\n- Principal Global Investors \u2013 LargeCap S&P 500 Index Separate Account - 0.31%\n- T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. \u2013 T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund - .67%\n- T. Rowe Price/Brown Advisory \u2013 LargeCap Growth I Separate Account - .79%\n- Vanguard Group \u2013 Vanguard Primecap Fund - .45%\n- DFA/Vaughan Nelson/LA Capital \u2013 SmallCap Value II Separate Account - 1.28%\n- Principal Global/Borrow Hanley \u2013 MidCap Value III Separate Account - .81%\n- Prudential Investments, LLC \u2013 Prudential Jennison Mid Cap Growth A Fund - 1.07%\n- Vanguard Group \u2013 Vanguard Explorer Fund - .51%\n- Principal Global Investors/DFA \u2013 International SmallCap Separate Account - 1.46% \n- Vanguard Group \u2013 Vanguard International Growth Fund - 0.48%\n\n\nHere's how our retirement funds sit right now:\n\n**My 401K - ~$22K **\n\n* 68% (PLFPX) Principal Large Cap S&P 500 Index Separate Account R-6 (.31%)\n\n**Wife's Fidelity 403B - ~$10.2K**\n\n* 17% (VBTIX) Vanguard Total Bond Market Index I (.07%)\n* 15% (VTSNX) Vanguard Total Int'l Stock Index I (.12%)\n\n\nIn addition to my current 401K and my wife's new rolled-over IRA, I'm planning on fully funding a 2014 IRA before the April deadline (see below). Would it be crazy to simplify our portfolio down to just the following allocation? \n\n**My 401K - ~$22K**\n\n* 58% (VGSTX) Vanguard STAR Fund (.34%)\n\n**Wife's Rollover IRA - ~$10.2K**\n\n* 27% (VTSMX) Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (.17%)\n\n**Vanguard IRA - $5.5K**\n\n* 15% (VTSMX) Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (.17%)\n\n\nThis would give us a US/Int'l/Bond mix of about 64/13/20, respectively. We're both in our mid-20's, so I would plan on making our future contributions pull us up closer to an 80/20 stock/bond split overall. As I learn more about other possible complimentary holdings (REITs for example), I'll be looking into maybe adding some of that in as well. \n\nAdditionally, since all of our bond funds would be through the VGSTX fund, could someone tell me a little more about the nature of the bond exposure I'm getting with VGSTX and if its a stupid idea to hold these bonds? I'm not sure how to interpret to the information about the bonds that VGSTX holds off of the M* XRay results. I will say M* indicates that all bond exposure is extensive in interest sensitivity, and of medium credit quality (A). The avg duration is ~7 yrs, and avg maturity is 11. \n\nPlease let me know of any information I could provide that might help the conversation along here. \n\nHappy Holidays",
