  "selftext": "Almost every day we hear about how great all of the mobile providers are in commercials that run continually on Television and other media outlets. For a while now leading mobile telecom provider Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) has been the king of the hill. The other leading mobile telecom companies have been AT&T, Inc. (T), and Sprint Corporation (S).\n\nA year ago nobody would even mention T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) as a market leading mobile provider, but today the stock chart of T-Mobile (TMUS) stock is painting a different picture. The stock is now a takeover candidate if you look at the sideways base it is making on the daily chart. The weekly chart could be setting up for a breakout move in the next few weeks. Usually, the stock charts don't lie and this stock looks attractive.\n\nRecently, T-Mobile (TMUS) has made a push to get new subscribers by covering the early termination fee from consumers other mobile providers. Recently T-Mobile merged with Metro PCS. Since that time the product has become much better. T-Mobile is even moving into the banking sector cashing checks without charging excessive fees. Personally, I could care less about the story, but the daily and weekly stock chart of TMUS stock makes me think this is a company that traders and investors must keep on the radar.\n\nNicholas Santiago\nInTheMoneyStocks",
