With some theaters starting to pull the film and other people hesitant to go based on the threats North Korea has made, Sony could recover some of their funds they would otherwise miss out on. \n\nFrom a marketing standpoint, they could try to be clever and make the digital download the \"official leak\" or something stupid like that. \n\nEdit: I agree that the \"terrorists\" win (in some regards) if this is done, but, in a weird way, I think to flip the script and make it so that anyone, anywhere with an internet connection could legally watch the movie, would be some kind of poetic justice. For the record, I plan on going to see it in theaters. (Well, can't do that anymore...) \n\nEdit2: For those spamming my inbox saying I stole my idea from a Verge article: Take the time to look at when I posted this comment. Then look at when the Verge article was posted. Tl;dr: I posted this at 9:00am, Verge at 10:00am. ",
