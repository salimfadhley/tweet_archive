Currently I am running the nouveau driver for my graphics card and it works just fine. For one of my classes at school, we are programming to target the GPU, specifically using CUDA, The card I have (NVS 300, not great I know but it&#39;s what I had) supports CUDA (16 cores) but in order to use it, the proprietary drivers must be used. I looked up the model via the wiki links and found that I need the nvidia-340xx driver. I installed the driver package and the libgl. When rebooting, it hangs after starting systemd (probably when loading the kernel module, but the &quot;starting version 224&quot; is what is left on the screen). I am able to log into another tty but the video flashes and is off-centered on the screen. From the second tty I am able to remove the nvidia340xx and reinstall nouveau, reboot and all is good. Are there any suggestions on how I can get the proprietary driver to work?\nHere is the video card:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ lspci -nnk | grep -i vga -A3\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [NVS 300] [10de:10d8] (rev a2)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device [103c:0862]\n    Kernel driver in use: nouveau\n    Kernel modules: nouveau\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
