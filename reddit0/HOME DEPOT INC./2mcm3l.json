I am almost positive I will be using Dimm's press style. As my first build I'm setting the bar low.\n\nMy question: First, how and where can I get which veneers. I just need a lot of pointers. Titebond three and BB 1/8th is what to aim for? I have a local southerlands, lowes, home depot, S&S, \"quality lumber sales inc.\" and access to internet stores. \n\nThanks in advance!",
