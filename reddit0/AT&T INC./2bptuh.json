The total price was $38 with shipping. I waited patiently for it to arrive, but it took over two weeks. Why so long? Because when I finally received it, I realized they shipped it to the wrong address!  </p>\n\n<p>So, it eventually got to me, but upon opening the package I saw that they sent me an Original Natural Gum Rubber/Latex Keeper, not the silicone Moon Cup.    </p>\n\n<p>I considered sending it back, but wasn&#39;t sure if they would accept exchanges for a personal product such as this. After some thought, I accepted that I would not use the latex Keeper because it smelled. BAD. It had a very strong chemical smell, and it was also very stiff. I contacted The Keeper, Inc. via email and requested an exchange and also mentioned that my order was sent to the wrong address. I was notified that an exchange would be possible, so I replied with my correct address and sent my latex Keeper back that day. This was on June 6th, 2014.  </p>\n\n<p>Well, I waited a while. I thought maybe they screwed up the address again and it would eventually find its way to me. On June 26th, 20 days after my email requesting an exchange, and with no package to be found, I emailed The Keeper Inc. again for an update. No reply.  </p>\n\n<p>I emailed them again on July 3rd and they replied, claiming that I never replied with my address. WTF?! I replied the day I sent the item back, June 6th! Okay, maybe it got lost in spam mail or something. I replied with my correct address once again on July 3rd.  </p>\n\n<p>A few days passed and I hadn&#39;t received confirmation or any reply at all that my exchange had shipped. On July 7th I emailed them again, asking if they got my address and if my exchange was on its way. No reply. I sent another email on July 8th. No reply. A third email was sent on July 9th. I assumed I wouldn&#39;t get a reply, so in addition to the email I called them. No answer. I left a message detailing my issue.  </p>\n\n<p>On July 10th I woke up and still had no reply via email or phone call from The Keeper, Inc. I decided to call again, and finally, some one answered! She told me that the person who I was communicating with via email was out on vacation, and that she was standing in for her. She said she would ship out my exchange immediately the following day. I provided her with my shipping address (AGAIN) and she gave me a tracking number. YESS! </p>\n\n<p>A few days pass and I check the tracking number. It&#39;s invalid. NOOO. I held out hope, thinking maybe MAYBE this time they sent it and I would be receiving my long-awaited Keeper Moon Cup and I could finally use it instead of tampons! I have been eagerly checking my mail every day since, but all in vain.  </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, July 24th, I tried calling them again, 5 times. I also left another message, this time just requesting a refund. This is stupid ridiculous. I&#39;ve wasted $38 and whole lot of my free time and energy. </p>\n\n<p>Today, on July 25th 2014, I still haven&#39;t gotten a reply, and I&#39;ve called two more times. I don&#39;t know what to do at this point. My original purchase was made with my debit card, so I don&#39;t think I can dispute the charge. I&#39;m just really frustrated with this company, and want to prevent some one else from experiencing the same thing I did.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve gone through 3 periods while waiting for my menstrual cup, each time cursing The Keeper, Inc. and their shitty business practices. I have saved all the emails to back up my story. Do yourself a favor and purchase from another reputable company, don&#39;t waste your time and money with The Keeper, Inc.  </p>\n\n<p>x-posted to <a href=\"/r/TwoxChromosomes\">r/TwoxChromosomes</a> &amp; <a href=\"/r/MenstrualCups\">r/MenstrualCups</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
