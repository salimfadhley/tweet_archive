I have both consoles that I play equally, I just noticed after this E3 that Sony were criticized more for these practices. I noticed big YouTubers like TotalBiscuit made a point in his latest video against PS's decision in this yet I didn't really see MS mentioned. Yes, I know MS did get negative press for the Tomb Raider deal. )\n\nAs the topic says really. \n\nCoD DLC was exclusive for years on Xbox and although I absolutely believe that parity is best, it seems Sony are taking a lot more brunt for the new deal than MS ever did. Games like Rise of the Tomb Raider and Titan Fall were bought timed exclusive and full exclusive by MS, I don't see how that's any worse than the exclusive missions Sony often buys for multi-platform games.\n\nIt may seem like I'm backing Sony here but I'm not necessarily. I think exclusive content, timed content and simply bought exclusive that would otherwise been multi-format are bad practice but I don't think Sony should be taking all the bad / negative comments when seemingly MS get off (relatively speaking, I know MS do receive stick for it as well) free when they do the same thing. \n\n",
