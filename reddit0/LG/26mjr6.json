Some of you may remember me from such /r/Android hits as \"HTC America's AMA\" or \"Y U No Removal Battery?!\"\n\nI now am at T-Mobile, and am very excited to announce the launch of the brand new LG G3! I'm even more excited to announce the **LG G3 Open Beta Sweepstakes**. T-Mobile's partner, LG, will be giving away advanced-release Beta models (final hardware, non-final software) to a lucky entrant every day until June 29th.\n\nAll you need to do to be entered is to fill out the very short form on this web page: [https://explore.t-mobile.com/lg-g3](https://explore.t-mobile.com/lg-g3). \n\n**Please read the rules of the contest if you have questions.**\n\nAnd this is an open beta...we WANT you to talk about the phone. Give us your unfiltered opinions on the device and how it stacks up to other Android models. \n\nThanks and good luck!",
