  "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if this is an extremely unpopular opinion but I see a lot of people who value a character based off of gameplay alone and not on actual character problem. However, if you ask me, uniform great gameplay is\u2026 kind of dull. I mean, a season can work despite a straight Pagonging (I mean, Borneo itself is really amazing) but players like Kim or Brian who might themselves be interesting as people can make both a season and a character boring since they\u2019re so gameplay-centric with the game so extremely on lockdown that nothing happens and a lot of other characters are seen as \u201cuseless\u201d because they cannot strategically top the mastermind. \n\nI submit to you that bad gameplay makes a season fun for many reasons.\n\n**1) It makes for unpredictability.**\n\nTake One World; as soon as the merge happened Kim had all eleven other people wrapped around her finger and after a crazy round or two every boot was telegraphed and no one was going to do a damn thing about it. \n\nIn contrast, take Gabon, where the merge is marred by a comedy of errors that not only makes for unpredictable twists, but excellent downfalls. Marcus boned the F10 vote so badly that he went from the Kota God to one of the snakes gotten rid of. Sugar was so focused on camera whoring that she kept entertaining characters like Bob around and giving hell to the \u201cbaddies.\u201d\n\nCagayan is no exception. The pre-merge was made golden from the very first episode, where an insane comedy of errors stripped Luzon of its two strongest men in favor of a horrific, rice-burning lunatic. Post-merge you have Sarah imploding and setting a chaotic post-merge into chaos where we\u2019re at the F6 and have no clue who\u2019s going home or who\u2019s winning. That\u2019s a much more fun season than the seasons prior where Cochran was constantly in control and we knew he was on his way to the end.\n\nThis isn\u2019t always the case; a lot of the insanity brought on in Pearl Islands is brought on by JFP\u2019s masterful flip flopping that could have easily led to a victory, and the bad gameplay by Galu in Samoa didn\u2019t fix the editing flops that caused the airtime to be largely sucked up by Russell Hantz. Regardless, bad gameplay will make a wild season 9 times out of 10 just by it being there.\n\n**B) Bad gameplay comes from flawed characters and flawed characters are more entertaining.**\n\nPlayers like Kim are amazing at the game and as such will get the most airtime. However\u2026 they are not very complex characters. They are perfect and perfect characters aren\u2019t all that entertaining. It makes for a straight-arrow character arc where a character comes in perfect and leaves perfect. They also have a habit of axing wild cards early, leaving only a bunch of sheep to follow them to the end. \n\nNow take the flawed strategic leaders who fuck things up a lot. John Carroll from Marquesas is an egotistical unconventional leader waiting to be thrown down. Tony is a hyperactive kid-in-a-candy-store strategy giant who has voted right every single time but very clearly is pissing off his tribe and getting into childish arguments with Kass. The women\u2019s alliance in Vanuatu is so implosive and in-fighting that a 63-year-old lesbian rancher that could barely walk starts leading all the blindsides. \n\nThen there are characters completely removed from strategy that have their own level of legend. Courtney is too busy snarking to be talking about non-Jean-Robert-related strategy. Coach is too busy chasing dragons. Woo is too busy being a ninja pokemon. Greg is too busy being out of his mind. Rudy is too busy being Rudy. Rupert is too busy being all that is honorable and good in his own mind. So many legends now and then are fun because they are diversions from big, long strategy talks and are just tons of fun.\n\nEven better, there are flawed characters that are human and often relatable. Dreamz is a formerly homeless man whose desire to set a good example for kids like he was contrasts with a desperate need to get as much money as possible. Twila is a struggling truck driver from a man\u2019s world stuck on an all women\u2019s tribe and immediately doesn\u2019t fit in and whose confrontational spirit leads to her losing the game despite all her best efforts. These flawed characters are much more realistic than the perfect characters who run the game and I\u2019d watch them anyday over the predictable ones who don\u2019t change or grow at all.\n\n**III) Bad gameplay gets rid of less entertaining characters.**\n\nIn the Boston Rob era, a good player will get rid of anyone who looks remotely like a wild card in exchange for really shitty people or boring people. Matt Elrod, a super heroic character, is taken out by Rob and in any normal season would end right there while he hangs out with obnoxious Phillips and useless Natalies. It\u2019s why in the Final 5 Kim had the quiet, mousy Christina and spiteful, egotistical Alicia instead of the Jonases and Kats of the season. \n\nHowever, seasons like Nicaragua are so implosive that habitual backstabbers like Chase get all the heavy work done after taking out threats like Brenda who are not quite as entertaining, leaving room for the Fabios of the world to make us laugh and do silly things, and the Dans who have a funny quip every now and again that you\u2019d never expect in a million years to make the final 5. The same goes for Cagayan- Tony is so busy taking out threats to him that he loses the relatively boring LJ in exchange for working with super ninja Woo who always can take over any scene they\u2019re in. Because they\u2019re not thinking straight, they don\u2019t vote out the Chris Daugherties that makes a season fun, they keep them along and throw out the LeAnns and LJs that are in his way. \n\n**Four) So many huge moments came from the failure of players, even moreso than the success of others. I\u2019ll just make a list and let you decide for yourself.**\n\nA. The Alphabet Strategy.\n\nB. The Samburu conflict arc.\n\nC. The Kelly Goldsmith vote.\n\nD. The fall of the Rotu 4.\n\nE. Purple Rock.\n\nF. The men fuck up the first challege in Amazon.\n\nG. Sandra screws JFP aaaaaaaand Burton.\n\nH. The LeAnn vote.\n\nI. Ulong sucks at life.\n\nJ. Ian gives up the game.\n\nK. Danni sneaks through the NuYaxhas. \n\nL. Dreamz doesn\u2019t fulfill the car deal.\n\nM. Edgardo vote.\n\nN. The Challenge Throwing Extravaganza in the China Swap.\n\nO. Every time an idol is brought into focus in China by someone whose name starts with Ja.\n\nP. Jason Siska and the fucking stick.\n\nQ. Erik gives up immunity.\n\nR. Marcus is overthrown because he can\u2019t commit. \n\nS. Randy is given a fake idol because Sugar is a bitch. \n\nT. Tyson votes himself out.\n\nU. J.T. and the love letter.\n\nV. Both times Russell implodes.\n\nW. Fabio wins because everyone else sucks.\n\nX. Matsing sucks.\n\nY. The Jeff Kent vote chaos.\n\nZ. Malcolm #yoloing the Phillip vote *is pelted with tomatoes*\n\n$. Brad leads to his own demise.\n\n!. Ciera draws rocks because Gervase won\u2019t shut up.\n\n?. Luzon implodes in two votes.\n\n#chaoskass. Sarah is the pawn, she\u2019s the swing vote!\n\nThese are just a quick list of the 30 biggest moments and storylines I can think of caused by bad gameplay moreso than good. These storylines, seasons and moments in the hands of a great player would likely be neutralized to a point that\u2019s masterfully done but cockblocks any of the crazy things that could happen if they weren\u2019t there and we let a bunch of bat-shit crazies run amok in the killing fields.\n\n**Conclusion, thank God**\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love players like Earl and Kim who are just too goddamn cool for school and control everything. I like it when we can see some master class domination, and I like strategy in general. I just believe that it always makes for much better Survivor seasons when people suck at the game. It makes it crazier, it makes for better characters, it makes for better storylines, and it makes for much more memorable, legendary Survivor.",
