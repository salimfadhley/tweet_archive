I am happy to join you today to answer your questions as the 2014 regular season winds down and the playoff races heat up. So feel free to ask me almost anything. I will be here for 90 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter Proof: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFL/status/526844235207938050\">https://twitter.com/CFL/status/526844235207938050</a></p>\n\n<p>Hey everyone, I only have five more minutes left to answer your questions, then I have to take off! It&#39;s municipal election night in Toronto so I have to go vote! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to ask me questions. Officiating is an important part of our game. Our officials do an excellent job. We will always strive for perfection. I believe a big part of my job is communication - not only with our officials, teams, players and coaches, but with our fans and media as well. I am glad we had this opportunity. I look forward to seeing you on the road to the 102nd Grey Cup in Vancouver. Thanks for being the best fans in sports.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
