The email also had a link to a [PDF copy of the GAO report](http://grayson.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=P5CALbuV9x7n1YLBgKYEAp%2BlLzYG3uiI) involving said \"Fed Audit\".\n\n-------\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that Congressman Ron Paul and I are the parents of the GAO\u2019s audit of the Federal Reserve. And I say that knowing full well that Dr. Paul has somewhat complicated views regarding gay marriage.\n\nAnyway, one of our love children is a massive 251-page GAO report technocratically entitled \u201cOpportunities Exist to Strengthen Policies and Processes for Managing Emergency Assistance.\u201d It is almost as weighty as that 13-lb. baby born in Germany last week, named Jihad. It also is the first independent audit of the Federal Reserve in the Fed\u2019s 99-year history.\n\nFeel free to take a look at it yourself, it\u2019s right here. It documents Wall Street bailouts by the Fed that dwarf the $700 billion TARP, and everything else you\u2019ve heard about.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think that I\u2019m dramatizing or amplifying what this GAO report says, so I\u2019m just going to list some of my favorite parts, by page number.\n\nPage 131 \u2013 The total lending for the Fed\u2019s \u201cbroad-based emergency programs\u201d was $16,115,000,000,000. That\u2019s right, more than $16 trillion. The four largest recipients, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, received more than a trillion dollars each. The 5th largest recipient was Barclays PLC. The 8th was the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, PLC. The 9th was Deutsche Bank AG. The 10th was UBS AG. These four institutions each got between a quarter of a trillion and a trillion dollars. None of them is an American bank.\n\nPages 133 & 137 \u2013 Some of these \u201cbroad-based emergency program\u201d loans were long-term, and some were short-term. But the \u201cterm-adjusted borrowing\u201d was equivalent to a total of $1,139,000,000,000 more than one year. That\u2019s more than $1 trillion out the door. Lending for these programs in fact peaked at more than $1 trillion.\n\nPages 135 & 196 \u2013 Sixty percent of the $738 billion \u201cCommercial Paper Funding Facility\u201d went to the subsidiaries of foreign banks. 36% of the $71 billion Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility also went to subsidiaries of foreign banks.\n\nPage 205 \u2013 Separate and apart from these \u201cbroad-based emergency program\u201d loans were another $10,057,000,000,000 in \u201ccurrency swaps.\u201d In the \u201ccurrency swaps,\u201d the Fed handed dollars to foreign central banks, no strings attached, to fund bailouts in other countries. The Fed\u2019s only \u201ccollateral\u201d was a corresponding amount of foreign currency, which never left the Fed\u2019s books (even to be deposited to earn interest), plus a promise to repay. But the Fed agreed to give back the foreign currency at the original exchange rate, even if the foreign currency appreciated in value during the period of the swap. These currency swaps and the \u201cbroad-based emergency program\u201d loans, together, totaled more than $26 trillion. That\u2019s almost $100,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. That\u2019s an amount equal to more than seven years of federal spending -- on the military, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, and everything else. And around twice American\u2019s total GNP.\n\nPage 201 \u2013 Here again, these \u201cswaps\u201d were of varying length, but on Dec. 4, 2008, there were $588,000,000,000 outstanding. That\u2019s almost $2,000 for every American. All sent to foreign countries. That\u2019s more than twenty times as much as our foreign aid budget.\n\nPage 129 \u2013 In October 2008, the Fed gave $60,000,000,000 to the Swiss National Bank with the specific understanding that the money would be used to bail out UBS, a Swiss bank. Not an American bank. A Swiss bank.\n\nPages 3 & 4 \u2013 In addition to the \u201cbroad-based programs,\u201d and in addition to the \u201ccurrency swaps,\u201d there have been hundreds of billions of dollars in Fed loans called \u201cassistance to individual institutions.\u201d This has included Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America, and \u201csome primary dealers.\u201d The Fed decided unilaterally who received this \u201cassistance,\u201d and who didn\u2019t.\n\nPages 101 & 173 \u2013 You may have heard somewhere that these were riskless transactions, where the Fed always had enough collateral to avoid losses. Not true. The \u201cMaiden Lane I\u201d bailout fund was in the hole for almost two years.\n\nPage 4 \u2013 You also may have heard somewhere that all this money was paid back. Not true. The GAO lists five Fed bailout programs that still have amounts outstanding, including $909,000,000,000 (just under a trillion dollars) for the Fed\u2019s Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchase Program alone. That\u2019s almost $3,000 for every American.\n\nPage 126 \u2013 In contemporaneous documents, the Fed apparently did not even take a stab at explaining why it helped some banks (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) and not others. After the fact, the Fed referred vaguely to \u201cstrains in the financial markets,\u201d \u201ctransitional credit,\u201d and the Fed\u2019s all-time favorite rationale for everything it does, \u201cincreasing liquidity.\u201d\n\n81 different places in the GAO report \u2013 The Fed applied nothing even resembling a consistent policy toward valuing the assets that it acquired. Sometimes it asked its counterparty to take a \u201chaircut\u201d (discount), sometimes it didn\u2019t. Having read the whole report, I see no rhyme or reason to those decisions, with billions upon billions of dollars at stake.\n\nPage 2 \u2013 As massive as these enumerated Fed bailouts were, there were yet more. The GAO did not even endeavor to analyze the Fed\u2019s discount window lending, or its single-tranche term repurchase agreements.\n\nPages 13 & 14 \u2013 And the Fed wasn\u2019t the only one bailing out Wall Street, of course. On top of what the Fed did, there was the $700,000,000,000 TARP program authorized by Congress (which I voted against). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) also provided a federal guarantee for $600,000,000,000 in bonds issued by Wall Street.\n\nThere is one thing that I\u2019d like to add to this, which isn\u2019t in the GAO\u2019s report. All this is something new, very new. For the first 96 years of the Fed\u2019s existence, the Fed\u2019s primary market activities were to buy or sell U.S. Treasury bonds (to change the money supply), and to lend at the \u201cdiscount window.\u201d Neither of these activities permitted the Fed to play favorites. But the programs that the GAO audited are fundamentally different. They allowed the Fed to choose winners and losers.\n\nSo what does all this mean? Here are some short observations:\n\n(1) In the case of TARP, at least The People\u2019s representatives got a vote. In the case of the Fed\u2019s bailouts, which were roughly 20 times as substantial, there was never any vote. Unelected functionaries, with all sorts of ties to Wall Street, handed out trillions of dollars to Wall Street. That\u2019s now how a democracy should function, or even can function.\n\n(2) The notion that this was all without risk, just because the Fed can keep printing money, is both laughable and cryable (if that were a word). Leaving aside the example of Germany\u2019s hyperinflation in 1923, we have the more recent examples of Iceland (75% of GNP gone when the central bank took over three failed banks) and Ireland (100% of GNP gone when the central bank tried to rescue property firms).\n\n(3) In the same way that American troops cannot act as police officers for the world, our central bank cannot act as piggy bank for the world. If the European Central Bank wants to bail out UBS, fine. But there is no reason why our money should be involved in that.\n\n(4) For the Fed to pick and choose among aid recipients, and then pick and choose who takes a \u201chaircut\u201d and who doesn\u2019t, is both corporate welfare and socialism. The Fed is a central bank, not a barber shop.\n\n(5) The main, if not the sole, qualification for getting help from the Fed was to have lost huge amounts of money. The Fed bailouts rewarded failure, and penalized success. (If you don\u2019t believe me, ask Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan.) The Fed helped the losers to squander and destroy even more capital.\n\n(6) During all the time that the Fed was stuffing money into the pockets of failed banks, many Americans couldn\u2019t borrow a dime for a home, a car, or anything else. If the Fed had extended $26 trillion in credit to the American people instead of Wall Street, would there be 24 million Americans today who can\u2019t find a full-time job?\n\nAnd here\u2019s what bothers me most about all this: it can happen again. I\u2019ve called the GAO report a bailout autopsy. But it\u2019s an autopsy of the undead.\n\nCourage,\n\nAlan Grayson",
