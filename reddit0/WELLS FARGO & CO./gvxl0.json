To do this, my mom opened up a new bank account to use for the insurance and only put in a small amount so they would accept us. We're not poor, but we are definelty low middle class. I recently had heart surgery and its super expensive. My mom is scared the insurance co. is gonna find the rest of our money and will cancel our insurance, leaving us to pay for all of the surgery. \n\nSo yeah, mom is taking all our savings (around $120k) and putting it in a fire-proof box inside our local Wells Fargo. She thinks the insurance co. is gonna use her SS# to find our other bank account. Most of it is in CDs right now but I guess she's just going to cancel those. I told her to not do anything risky with our money until I graduate college (currently a high school junior, going to apply to UCs) but she's ignoring me. I really just want to get a job out of college and support myself, and then she can do whatever she wants with the rest. \n\nShould I stop this? I need some solid evidence that its safer in the bank. Or am I just over reacting? Lemme know reddit.  ",
