Now it seems like they're posted fairly frequently, at least a few a day. They're just so shit in every way. \n\n- Can't open it on phone easily. I use Alien Blue and if I open it then it just refreshes the page. I could open it in Safari but fuck that, I just want one click (e.g. gfycat), not one click to open it up, one click on the blue dot, one click on open it in safari, one click to play the video, and then a few clicks to close all that shit and get back to Alien Blue.\n\n- Requires more clicks on computer too. I use RES and you have to expand the link and then click the video, whereas for streamable or gfycat you can just hover your cursor over it and it'll play.\n\n- The link is more likely to go down since it's someone who posts it and can easily delete it, as has happened with the \"Aguero stops corner to bring medical help for an Everton fan\" post. Doesn't happen so much with gfycat/streamable because once they're uploaded they're just sort of floating out there on the internet. \n\nOne potential benefit of posting it via Twitter is that you also get the account who posted it (which can be useful in some cases) and a caption that may be useful. However in most cases the account and caption don't matter (in fact I'd bet in most cases the info in the caption can be put in the post title if it's so important).\n\nP.S. Vine also sucks but this post is about Twitter video/gif posts. Let's try to stick to gfycat/streamable/youtube.",
