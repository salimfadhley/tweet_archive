  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs a Honda owner my whole life, i'm taking a huge plunge with Audi (a car I used to play with as a hot-wheel and vowed I would buy when I got older.) I found a 2006 Audi A4 (2.0T 6-speed manual, FWD, Base trim) with 40,000 miles (VERY low mileage!) The previous owner had leased it and got very consistent maintenance at Hawaiian Audi dealerships. Since he was from Hawaii I'm assuming he didn't have very  much places to go.\n\nI can't make up my m ind though. It seems like everything is in order, reputable dealer, good price, great condition, drives like a dream! Low mileage... It's beautiful!\n\nI'm only doubting its notorious reliability. I need some reassurance from this community if that's possible. I don't mind periodic maintenance (as with any car,) but I keep hearing about shit breaking after a week, check engine lights coming on, and just overall dislike... It's leaving a bad taste in my mouth and making my feet cold. I understand German cars have higher maintenance cost (especially performance/luxury cars like this) and that's fine with me, but I want something that's reasonable. Not something that breaks as often as I'm hearing rumors of.\n\nPlease help!\n\nHere it is http://images.cars.com/phototab/DMI/188007/123131/01.jpg",
