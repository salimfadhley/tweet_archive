Long time lurker, first time poster, you know the drill, right?</p>\n\n<p>This is the most exciting TFR story I&#39;ve got. This was back in... I want to say 2005?  Before the proliferation of smartphones, etc. It&#39;s about the time I worked at a gas station/convenience store for one whole day and ended up as a Manager and a District Manager&#39;s worst nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d taken the job not two days before and was told to show up at seven AM on a monday for training.  No big deal, right?  The Manager (TM) certainly seemed stable enough at the time, but I suppose that&#39;s what they say about all the crazies.</p>\n\n<p>So. I show up at 7am, bright eyed and bushy tailed and ready to get to work.  I&#39;m immediately introduced to the Young Lady (YL) who&#39;s been tasked with training me by TM. TM spends the first twenty minutes of my shift not training me, but ranting and rambling about how she just worked a double graveyard and how she&#39;s bushed, and how this place just sucks her dry... you get the idea.  Then she reiterates that YL&#39;s going to be with me all day, training me step by step, and is then gone in a puff of smoke. Gone home to get some much-deserved sleep.  Leaves her home number on a scrap of paper behind the counter &quot;In Case Of Emergencies Only.&quot; Sensible enough.</p>\n\n<p>So we get down to business.  YL&#39;s shocked that I&#39;m already somewhat register- and computer-literate, and so takes the opportunity to abandon me in the backroom doing a few hours of computer training that I gather is supposed to encompass the entirety of my day.  When I finish my computer training, I step out into the main store area to be relieved of duty.  YL instead informs me that we&#39;re now going to do some hands-on training.</p>\n\n<p>...Weird... but fine... I guess... I mean, I&#39;m not going to scoff at a few extra hours on my paycheck, so whatever. Let&#39;s do some hands on work.</p>\n\n<p>The hands-on work goes on for about an hour and a half (bringing my day to about four and a half hours at this point?), until YL pulls me aside and announces, with a beaming shit-eating grin on her face,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>YL: You know what?  I think, yeah. I think fuck this place.</p>\n\n<p>CIB: Fuck this place?</p>\n\n<p>YL: Yeah, man, fuck it. It&#39;s bullshit anyway. Fuck everything. I quit.</p>\n\n<p>CIB: Like in two weeks?</p>\n\n<p>YL: Like, I mean, like now.</p>\n\n<p>CIB: ...what?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that, she tears off her smock, lights a cigarette, and walks out of the joint, leaving me to mind the store alone. I don&#39;t know how to do cash drops, I don&#39;t know how to do most of this shit. I&#39;ve been here for <em>four hours tops.</em></p>\n\n<p>You must be kidding me.</p>\n\n<p>YL locks the door to the back room, shoves the key underneath the door, and is gone forever.</p>\n\n<p>So, like the nice young man I am, I call TM&#39;s emergency number.  The phone rings and rings and rings for maybe two minutes straight before she finally answers, mid-snore, with a befuddled </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TM: ...whuzzah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I promptly explain the situation to her and tell her that I need help.  She tells me to hold tight, and that she&#39;s going to call her Assistant Manager (AM) to come and help.</p>\n\n<p>You know where this is going.</p>\n\n<p>AM never comes. I&#39;m waiting for another two hours, and AM never shows up.  I call TM back.  Same deal.  Two minutes of continuous ringing. She promises something else. Hangs up on me.</p>\n\n<p>We go through this process four more times over the course of two more hours, when the next person on-shift is due to show up anyway.  He never shows.  Naturally.  So I call TM until she finally just <em>takes her phone off the hook so I can&#39;t call her anymore.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is the part of the story where I start to freak out.</p>\n\n<p>I have no other numbers.  I know no one else who works here. </p>\n\n<p>I am alone. No way to clock out, no way to hide, no way to lock the doors, nothing.  Just work.  Only work.  Forever and ever and ever and ever.  I can see that this is how I die, I&#39;m sure of it.  I&#39;m in a really shitty, boring version of <em>Final Destination.</em></p>\n\n<p>At this point, I feel the need to call out the dudes who ran the tattoo shop across the street.  They&#39;d been coming in for cokes and energy drinks and such throughout the day, and had taken a keen interest in my well-being.  They were pretty &quot;up&quot; on the situation, and kept me reasonably calm throughout the day,  They noticed that I was starting to freak out.  Asked me what the situation was.  I explained.</p>\n\n<p>Just like that, these badasses jump into action: they bring me their phonebook with all the numbers of the other stores in the area circled, and they go to the local taco cart and get me a plate of tacos and a coke &quot;to keep my strength up.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not into dudes, but I considered asking these guys to marry me then and there.</p>\n\n<p>Fueled by tacos and sheer, unadulterated panic, I start making calls. Other stores are shocked by what&#39;s happened, but don&#39;t have anyone to spare.  They&#39;ve got no one.</p>\n\n<p>But.</p>\n\n<p>One of them gives me the District Manager&#39;s (DM) home number. Bingo.  I explained the situation to him, and listened as he went from perfectly congenial to absolutely terrified.  He tells me</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM: I&#39;m coming down there to personally relieve you from your shift...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But then he says the perfect combination of words to set me off:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM: ...but I&#39;m going to need about an hour and a half.  Is that okay?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Welcome to my breaking point.  I begin to shout and shout and shout.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>CIB: No, that is <em>not alright.</em>  Tell you what, DM - either you get down here in half an hour, or I am going to open the cash registers, the safe, turn the gas pumps on unlimited run and <strong>go home.</strong>  Is that what you want?? FREE GAS AND FREE MONEY FOR EVERYONE WHO COMES INTO THE STORE UNTIL THERE&#39;S NO MORE MONEY! <strong>IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!</strong></p>\n\n<p>DM: ...I&#39;ll be there in twenty minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I now see what has happened: I have officially been taken hostage by this store, and have taken it hostage in return.  I am now the crazy person in the situation. I&#39;m the movie bad guy.  I&#39;m the one making demands.</p>\n\n<p>But you know what?  He got there in fifteen minutes flat.</p>\n\n<p>And you know what? He was very nice, all said and told.  He apologized profusely, even helped me <em>actually kick in</em> the locked backroom door so I could clock out all proper-like. It&#39;s 10:30pm. Finally.</p>\n\n<p>But then TM, in her pajamas, eyes bloodshot and wild, murderous and back from the dead like the last bad guy in <em>Die Hard</em>, comes storming into the store, screaming at DM, who had apparently gotten her to answer her phone during his trip over:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TM: DM, how <em>fucking dare</em> you tell me how to run <em>my store</em>, I swear to <em>fuck</em> you&#39;ve been telling me what to do for <em>too long now</em> and I am telling you for the last time--</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>DM turns to me as TM is shrieking, and he says something that makes me start laughing like a psychotic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM: Go home, CIB. I&#39;ve got this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shit, you don&#39;t have to tell me twice, amigo.  I&#39;m gone.  When I get to the door, finally, he calls after me and says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM: I really hope this doesn&#39;t affect your future with the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I never went back.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  Holy shit, my very first Gold! Thanks, anonymous internet patron! I&#39;m sincerely glad I could provide some laughs through my suffering. You beautiful bastard, whoever you are.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: Hot damn, you guys sure know how to make a dude feel loved. Didn&#39;t expect this to take off. Thanks for the kind words, all (well, most). I love this subreddit. You&#39;re all champions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
