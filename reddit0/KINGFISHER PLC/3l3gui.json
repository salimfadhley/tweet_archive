  "selftext": "My budget is $1800 USA including peripherals. \n\nI am okay with mail in rebates but i would really prefer that the build costs $1800 or less even without them\n\nThe main purpose for this computer is for video editing and other creative projects (such as artwork in Photoshop, illustrator, etc.) I will still be gaming on it shouldn't be 100% prioritized for editing, but that is the main focus. As for 3D rendering i do some just for my own personal creative stuff, but nothing professional grade or anything so that aspect shouldn't be too demanding lol\n\nI do not have any interest in overclocking *at first*, but i wanted to keep the option open for the future. this is the reason why i was planning on the i7-4790k rather then the 4790, because i wanted the option to be there for the future. however i see in your guide that overclocking does not help gaming, does overclocking help for editing? because if not then screw it i should just get the cheaper one lol\n\ni will be buying within the next 2-3 days (unless something comes up that prevents this, in which case i will make another post before i can buy :P there is no reason for that though, just saying.) \n\nI live in the USA, and i kind of have access to a micro center. there is one about an hour to two hours away from me, its address is \n\nSaint Davids Square Shopping Center\n550 Lancaster Ave\nSt Davids, PA 19087\n\nand from what i saw the only thing cheaper would be the cpu and idk if thats worth the trip. \n\n*however* there looks to be a micro center place in Philadelphia which is much closer, but i am not positive if its the same microcenter (its website isnt loading) its called \"University Micro Center Inc\" so is this the same company? also if i am buying within the next few days and need to pick up something from there during next week that will be during the pope visit, so that would be a HUGE pain in the ass. \n\nand no i dont seem to have a fry's electronics near me.\n\nAs for my peripherals i have a 900p gateway monitor (i forget the exact model, i can get it for you if you really need it, just ask) which i definitely want to replace if i am doing video editing, preferably a 1440p 144hz monitor, but if i have to sacrifice one of those two things i would sacrifice the 144hz, because its great for gaming and all but 1440p is more important for video editing. \n\nas for speakers i have the insignia NS-PCS21 speakers. they get the job done so i dont need anything better then what i already have (although the right speaker is starting to give out, i think there is a lose wire or something, hopefully i can fix that.) \n\nAs for mouse and keyboard i dont need anything fancy or mechanical or whatever, just a nice keyboard and mouse that get the job done. i *could* stick with the ones i have if i need to, but they are kind of old and dirty and the Cooler Master CM Storm Devastator Gaming Bundle is only like 30 bucks, so i was going to get it. however if i need to remove something to fit the budget i wont mind too much dropping it. \n\nAs for headphones i recently picked up TASCAM TH02-B Closed-Back headphones on amazon. i didn't get them in yet and they were really cheap, but r/headphones recommended them so i am sure its fine lol again i don't need anything too fancy, \n\n\ni do require an operating system, but i get windows 10 free with my college email so i don't need to worry about it :)\n\nas for internet i was planning on using a wireless connector that i already own, however if you mean for during the building process there is no reason i couldn't plug it into Ethernet while i download drivers and stuff. \n\nsome extra info is that while its not listed on my parts list, i will be getting a blu-ray drive as well as a 5.25 card reader, so if you want to suggest a different case keep that in mind. \n\nanother thing is that one of the major websites (i think it was newegg?) recommended a 750w power supply for the graphics card, and so i originally had that listed but then someone else told me that wasnt necessary and to get the 650w version, so i changed it to that but i also think that leaves little room for expansion without getting a whole new power supply so idk. \n\nalso since i wasn't overclocking i was planning on using the stock cooler, but people have been telling me i should get a better cooler. i was looking at the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO because its cheap and gets good reviews and also possibly the CRYORIG H7 49.0 CFM even though its a bit more expensive because it matches the black and white color scheme of everything else in my build. \n\nanyway i think thats everything you need to know, if i think of anything else i will make an edit. \n\nhere is my current parts list:\n\n[PCPartPicker part
