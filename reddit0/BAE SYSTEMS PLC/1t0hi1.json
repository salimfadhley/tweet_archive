Many of the 12 Senate Republicans up for re-election next year are facing primary challengers aligned with the tea party, including Mr. McConnell.</p>\n\n<p>In the House, Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) also has moved to undermine the power of the tea party, saying that groups supporting the movement had lost credibility in policy debates and accusing them of forcing GOP lawmakers to take ill-advised policy positions. That was a reference to the federal-government shutdown of October, which the public blamed largely on the Republican Party.</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) noted Mr. Boehner&#39;s frustration and said, &quot;I was frustrated, too.&quot; But he also said on NBC that the tea party represents &quot;very important elements of our conservative family, and I would prefer to keep those conversations within the family.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The effort to beat back challenges from the right goes beyond the defense industry. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups have been stepping in to help business-friendly Republicans aligned with the GOP leadership, a reaction to the government shutdown in October, which the business groups opposed, and a sign of worries that tea party-aligned candidates might try to eliminate tax breaks and spending favored by businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. McConnell delivered his message at the fundraiser hours after a candidate backed by a number of GOP leaders in Washington, and the Chamber of Commerce, beat a more conservative challenger in a special congressional election in Alabama.</p>\n\n<p>According to campaign-finance records, BAE Systems, a U.S. unit of U.K.-based BAE Systems PLC that works on such items as the F-35 jet fighter and the Bradley fighting vehicle, has given Mr. McConnell $5,000 so far this year, the maximum allowed, to help him beat back a 2014 challenge from tea-party ally Matt Bevin.\nBAE, which has a large presence in Kentucky, declined to comment on the fundraiser or its discussions with Mr. McConnell.\n&quot;Our political action committee&#39;s contributions reflect our support for candidates who believe in strong national security and defense and represent districts where BAE Systems is a part of the local community,&quot; said spokesman Brian Roehrkasse.\nMr. McConnell&#39;s Senate office referred questions to his 2014 re-election campaign. Josh Holmes, a senior adviser to the McConnell campaign, defended the senator&#39;s appeal. &quot;Sen. McConnell is a conservative who believes in a strong national defense and wants to ensure that those who share his opinion aren&#39;t silenced by a reluctance to voice their opinion in elections,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>The message appears to be rippling through the defense industry, where officials are voicing increasing resentment with tea party-aligned Republicans.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s definitely frustration within the defense community, and the frustration goes to tea partiers who are emphasizing cuts without internalizing the harm,&quot; said Roger Zakheim, an attorney at Covington &amp; Burling LLP who served until October as general counsel for the House Armed Services Committee. &quot;At times, our respective leaders in both branches have essentially allowed, and continue to allow, the military to be a pawn in the greater debate.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Mr. McConnell&#39;s pitch to the defense industry is a delicate one. As Senate Republican leader, he has supported sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts that have hit domestic programs and the Defense Department.</p>\n\n<p>Matt Hoskins, executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political-action committee backing Mr. McConnell&#39;s GOP challenger, called Mr. McConnell a hypocrite for casting himself as a defender of military spending while supporting the spending cuts. &quot;All he&#39;s really doing is saying &#39;nudge-nudge, wink-wink, you know I&#39;m a big spender, you know I&#39;ll take care of you,&#39; &quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What he&#39;s really saying is that he&#39;s a big spending Republican who will take care of these special interests if they help him in the primary,&quot; Mr. Hoskins said. &quot;It&#39;s, you scratch my back, I will scratch your back.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In Georgia, Lockheed Martin Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co. have already stepped in to support Rep. Jack Kingston, who is battling Rep. Paul Broun and others in the GOP primary for retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss&#39;s Senate seat. Mr. Kingston, who has faced accusations from the right that he is insufficiently committed to eliminating the president&#39;s health-care law, has collected at least $60,000 from defense firms for his campaign, according to finance records, making him a top recipient of defense industry dollars in the current campaign cycle.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to BAE&#39;s contribution, Mr. McConnell has drawn donations from Lockheed Martin and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., which have each donated $2,500 to his campaign, records show.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
