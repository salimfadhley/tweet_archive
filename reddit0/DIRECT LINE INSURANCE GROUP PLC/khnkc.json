They were the following:\n\nI moved address. I'm still in the same city. Objectively I now live in a slightly better area, more posh, I'd imagine lower crime.\n\nI changed my occupation from student to poker player. I've been playing poker a few years but never got around to making this change. I play poker entirely from home / self-employed and it requires zero driving to do as opposed to when I was a student I was driving every day to get to university.\n\nFinally I changed what I put down for the amount of miles I estimate I do in a year from 6000 to just 2000 as I hardly use my card.\n\nAt the end of this they calmly told me that my premium would be going up by \u00a3315 a year... as I currently pay \u00a3800 (a lot) this is a huge jump. I tried to argue that all three changes to my policy should mean a lowering of my premium but she said they had complex algorithms and that she couldn't tell me anything else. I'm soo pissed off and will probably cancel my policy shortly but I'm worried nobody else will give me anything cheaper.\n\nWhat possible reasons could justify these increases? I feel like the world is trying to rob me. My premium went up 25% this year anyway for no reason at all (I changed nothing) and apparently that was because of new laws and shit... now this... who can afford to run a car at these prices?!?!?!",
