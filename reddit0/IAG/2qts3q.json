My goal is to have at least 1 ticket paid for and I&#39;d like to sign up for 1 or 2 cards. I live in MKE but have access to ORD, which I assume would be cheaper, but if possible I&#39;d rather fly out of MKE. Right now I have the Barclay Arrival + which I will make the 3K minimum spend shortly. My FICO is 775, 5 hard inquiries (3 were for an auto loan that will drop off in February). I have done some research and found that I could get the CSP and transfer to 40K to BA, but I have read that BA has very high taxes and fees so that may not be the best option. Any suggestions are welcome and thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: typo\nEdit 2: I my final destination is Birmingham, UK I figured it would be cheaper to fly to London than anywhere else but after more research I found <a href=\"http://thepointsguy.com/2012/04/using-british-airways-avios-on-aer-lingus-to-avoid-taxes-and-fuel-surcharges/\">this post</a> on booking an Aer Lingus flight with BA Avios to Dublin to avoid the excesive taxes/fees, therefore(if I worked everything out correctly) I could try for the CSP and BA Chase 50k offer which would give more 90k miles, of which I would need to use only 80k. Flights from Dublin to Birmingham ar dirt cheap and I could use my Barclay Arrival Points to pay for that. If anyone has any suggestions on this that would be very helpful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
