  "selftext": "Today I have submitted two Excel assignment for a class, required and in very little ways helpful to computer literate people, to Pearson's MyITLab. Before I was able to submit these assignments, however, I hadd to wade through mounds of other bullshit. First, they sent books with Office 2010 even though they will not score any submissions in 2010 (they have to be in 2013). Second I had to wait for online customer help to resolve issues with my Student Access Code, the code was somehow invalid. (Felda was actually very quick for getting my situation fixed, so props to her) Alas, I have now found out that my posted score of 48% is highly erroneous. Simple stuff such as having a formula for the current date, =NOW(), is graded as 0/5 points! Now I have to go to my professor and, I will try to not transfer my rage about this onto him, and resolve this so I can pass the class. The book costs $204, I expect much better products when I pay this much! I decided to look into the company a little bit; it is a British company (Damn you Brits! JK, I Love JK Rowling and Rooney too much to hate the country)  traded on the LSE and NYSE, and has been doing as far as I can tell decent/well. C'mon people lets fucking destroy this company! Why should a HUGE publishing company start offering online education services!? If they must, they should at least make it not a piece of shit. Please Pearson PLC GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CLASS! #EndRant",
