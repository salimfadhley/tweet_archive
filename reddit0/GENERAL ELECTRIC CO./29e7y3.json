  "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI recently invested in VTSAX and am looking to pick another mutual fund to hedge against the downside risk within the fund. For example, the major holdings within the fund are as follows:\n\nApple Inc ORD (AAPL), Exxon Mobil Corp ORD (XOM)\t, Microsoft Corp ORD (MSFT), Google Inc ORD (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson ORD (JNJ), General Electric Co ORD (GE), Wells Fargo & Co ORD (WFC), Chevron Corp ORD (CVX), Berkshire Hathaway Inc ORD (BRK.B), and Procter & Gamble Co ORD (PG).\n\nTo my basic intuition, when the S&P 500 swings downwards, these funds will also take a dip. What mutual fund would best help me hedge against this downside risk? thanks for your comments.\n\n-deathstardown-",
