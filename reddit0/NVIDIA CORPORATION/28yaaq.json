Thanks for all your help :)**\n\n\nSo I have recently bought a NVidia Geforce GTX 750 Ti, because of great linux reviews (eg. phoronix). I had some troubles setting up the nvidia drivers (v 334.21) because I was using kernel 3.14, which I solved by reverting to 3.2.

Even LIMBO runs like shit, which used to run great on my AMD Radeon HD card.\n\nDoes anyone know why I have these performance problems? In windows it runs great, of course!\n\nEDIT: and with piss-poor, I mean not playable with something like 1 fps. I have also tried to run The Cave, Civilization and Portal which all ran really badly.\n\nEDIT2: debian jessie with kernel 3.2, running drivers from xedgers trusty ppa.\n\nEDIT3: I have run a few commands, and it looks like the system does not correctly recognize the available gpu ram:\n\n    jaapz at elmo in ~ \n    $ nvidia-smi\n    Tue Jun 24 19:18:28 2014       \n    +------------------------------------------------------+                       \n    | NVIDIA-SMI 337.25     Driver Version: 337.25         |                       \n    |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n    | GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.
