(ABBN), the world\u2019s biggest power-grid supplier, led a drop in shares sensitive to economic growth. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the second-largest maker of luxury goods, also retreated. UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), the country\u2019s two biggest banks, followed a gauge of European lenders lower.\nThe Swiss Market Index (SMI) slipped 0.9 percent to 6,072.12 at the close in Zurich. The measure of Switzerland\u2019s biggest and most actively traded companies sank 1.5 percent this week, its fourth straight decline. The gauge has still gained 2.3 percent in 2012 as the euro area sought to contain its debt crisis and as U.S. economic reports surpassed estimates. The broader Swiss Performance Index decreased 0.8 percent today.\n\u201cWe remain in a cycle that began in 2007, marked by periods of strong rebounds followed closely by market corrections,\u201d Francois Moute, chairman of Neuflize Private Assets in Paris, and Chief Executive Officer Olivia Giscard d\u2019Estaing wrote in a note. \u201cIn our opinion, this means it\u2019s best to remain cautious.\u201d\nThe volume of shares changing hands in the SMI was 8.3 percent higher today than the average of the last 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nECB BOND PROGRAM</p>\n\n<p>Swiss stocks extended their decline as European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot said that officials remain far from reviving their purchases of government bonds.\n\u201cI think that we are very far from that situation, the instrument hasn\u2019t been used for some time, but it\u2019s still there, I hope we never have to use it again,\u201d Knot said at an event in Amsterdam today, when asked about the need for the ECB to buy government bonds.\nThe cost of insuring against a Spanish default jumped to a record as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy struggles to prevent the nation from becoming the fourth euro-region member to need a bailout. Credit-default swaps on Spain rose 17 basis points to 498 as of 4 p.m. in London, surpassing the previous all-time high closing price of 493, according to CMA.\nGrowth in China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second biggest, slowed last quarter more than forecast to the weakest pace in almost three years. Gross domestic product rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing said today. That was a slower rate than the 8.4 percent growth predicted in a Bloomberg News survey.\nU.S. ECONOMY</p>\n\n<p>A report today showed that the cost of living in the U.S. increased at a slower pace in March. Consumer-price inflation climbed 0.3 percent, matching the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The index increased 0.4 percent in February.
