At the time he was hoping to make it big in music and I was an aspiring comedian.  One day a girl in my apartment complex wanted to meet him. I didn&#39;t think it was a big deal at the time because, well, he was just Dan, not famous or anything. But she was nervous so I told we could walk over there since the band was practicing and I\u2019d make a joke about the song they had needing &quot;more cowbell.&quot; Well I didn&#39;t have a cowbell, so I took over a $6 triangle I had.  I came in with the girl who wanted to meet him and said &quot;you know what this song needs? More triangle!&quot; Then he said &quot;that sounds good&quot; and grabbed it to add to the song. It sounded really good, and I let him borrow the triangle. I think he and the girl went on a date later too (he was single at this point).  The other day I was listening to one of his songs and heard the triangle. Suddenly I remembered he never gave it back to me. Now, before he had the triangle you guys weren&#39;t famous, and after he got the triangle, you guys became famous. So I think we can agree that I&#39;m a large reason Imagine Dragons is famous.  So with that being said, can I get my triangle back? I&#39;ll also accept royalties. </a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">HAHA! Thats an amazing story. It sounds like you had a big part of the magic push. I will check with Dan and find out where the triangle is. Oh, and Dan going on a date with your guest doesn&#39;t surprise me. ;) He&#39;s happily married now with a beautiful baby girl. Talk soon!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhbzl4?context=5\">Do you often follow strangers on Instagram?  Also, are you going to Pittsburgh in June?  If so, can you bring me some vinyl from your bands?  In addition, if question two is true you should buy a nice pair if shoes before hand (and maybe cut your hair \ud83d\ude2c)</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">HA! I do follow strangers! @whoisryanwalker and yes I think I will be in Pittsburgh in June. #BlackandYellow BTW, why should I buy a nice pair of shoes?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc1ik?context=5\">When did you first start playing music?  Was the keyboard your first and only instrument you have played?</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">When I was 12. My band was called Monkey Meets the Banana. We hit Vista, CA up with stickers all over town. I started on guitar and eventually moved to other instruments. Thanks for asking!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhukj7?context=5\">Why do you think there has been such an explosion of generic radio friendly corporate &quot;rock&quot; bands over the last decade?  Do you think it has to  do with the industry being driven more by singles and less by albums because of the digital revolution or do you have another theory?  Is hard rock (i.e. bands like Zepplin, Nirvana, etc) as a popular cultural phenomenon dead now?</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">I think there has always been corporate radio friendly rock music. At least on some kind of level. The music industry is always evolving and changing. I can only imagine where things will be in another ten years.. singles vs full albums, downloads vs steaming. I really see downloads becoming less and less over the years to come as streaming sites like Spotify and Beats music keep growing. Leaving a major gap in sells and royalties for artists. I think the new Nirvana&#39;s are bands like Cage The Elephant &amp; Tame Impala. My buddy @socialsoundsystem has his ears to the industry if you would ever like to pick his brain. Rock on!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhesmc?context=5\">Hey, Ryan! I saw you play with Dragons 3 times in 2013. Amazing every time. I was in the front row of the Orlando show in September and it was the best show I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of attending. I met you and the rest of the guys after the show and you were all nothing but humble and kind. Mac even helped me in completing my collection of the band&#39;s work (it&#39;s grown pretty out of control at this point). Anyway, thanks for the amazing memories. I hope there&#39;s another tour soon, I&#39;ve been craving to see a few more shows! Anyway, that aside. What&#39;s your funniest memory during the Night Visions tours? </a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">That would probably have to be Ben walking out in his underwear on stage during the support band&#39;s final song/set of tour. Atlas Genius, X Ambassadors, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc5dh?context=5\">Ryan! I met you at a coffee shop before a concert last spring in Minneapolis. You gave my 2 tickets to the sold out show and then we then barhopped after the concert with my friend and that girl Katie that worked at The Varsity (you knew her previously). That was one of the best nights of my college career and still one of my favorite stories to tell :) Thanks for being so chill and open to hanging out with people you don&#39;t even know!  2 questions: 1) Do you remember that? and 2) What is your favorite city that you visited on tour?</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">I remember that! I was late to meet you guys. Beer / Mexican food place, right? My favorite city is Amsterdam.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc269?context=5\">Hey bae  how&#39;s it like  NOT being on tour? I know it must be weird but great at the same time </a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">I write music all day but it can be boring. That&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this stuff.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhmpc4?context=5\">If they made a movie about your life,  who would play you (other than yourself)?</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Ethnicity aside, I would say Will Smith!

Please comment??</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Platz it a big time lover and one of my best friends. Actually, Platz is the only one who won&#39;t prank. We talk sports rather than hit bars. ;)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chheefd?context=5\">You mentioned listening to The Beach Boys in that Tweet.

Thank you for your time Mr. Walker.</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Nothing to do with Imagine Dragons and mores Dreamers.

Or was it just a one time thing?</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Of course! I&#39;m a touring member you&#39;ll see me on stage as long as Imagine Dragons is around <em>fingers crossed</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhebnv?context=5\">What&#39;s your favourite song off the dreamers album? i&#39;m torn between the dreamers, snapback and little things (the whole album is incredible it&#39;s so hard to choose)</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Thanks! Snapback is my favorite song off that record... The opening guitar riff is one of my favorite I&#39;ve ever written. It has this weird long bridge. There&#39;s basically  no rules to the structure of that song.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc4w0?context=5\">Why &quot;Wolf&quot;?

I don&#39;t know too much about monitor engineering but I know how valuable you are to the entertainment industry. Our guy Jared is super talented and we consider him a fifth member of the band. Thats how important he is to us. We use in ears. If you like to travel you can really do well between working for a touring act and having a steady local venue gig. Good luck and keep me posted on your progress!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhcvm5?context=5\">Hey Ryan!  Does Dreamers have any plans to do some shows in Canada in the future? (OSHEAGA MONTR\u00c9AL is coming up again wink wink!)  How did you end up playing for Imagine Dragons?  Favourite place in the world, either then home? </a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">No plans of touring right now. Just writing music at the moment!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhct78?context=5\">How did you get your passion for music? </a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Standing on side stage at a venue called Soma in San Diego.

Bad Religion, Korn, Blink etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhedg4?context=5\">Hey!

I&#39;m finding myself steering away from pictures etc. I rarely get recognized when I&#39;m in public and thats a really nice thing. It&#39;s amazing that I can have that kind of freedom and still support a really hot band like Imagine Dragons. When I am recognized I don&#39;t mind talking with fans and taking pictures... I&#39;ll stick around and chat as long as they want. I like interacting with everyone. It&#39;s enjoyable to me. In my mind nothing really separates me from a fan.

At the time he was hoping to make it big in music and I was an aspiring comedian.  One day a girl in my apartment complex wanted to meet him. I didn't think it was a big deal at the time because, well, he was just Dan, not famous or anything. But she was nervous so I told we could walk over there since the band was practicing and I\u2019d make a joke about the song they had needing \"more cowbell.\" Well I didn't have a cowbell, so I took over a $6 triangle I had.  I came in with the girl who wanted to meet him and said \"you know what this song needs? More triangle!\" Then he said \"that sounds good\" and grabbed it to add to the song. It sounded really good, and I let him borrow the triangle. I think he and the girl went on a date later too (he was single at this point\\).  The other day I was listening to one of his songs and heard the triangle. Suddenly I remembered he never gave it back to me. Now, before he had the triangle you guys weren't famous, and after he got the triangle, you guys became famous. So I think we can agree that I'm a large reason Imagine Dragons is famous.  So with that being said, can I get my triangle back? I'll also accept royalties. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhv8o1?context=5)|HAHA! Thats an amazing story. It sounds like you had a big part of the magic push. I will check with Dan and find out where the triangle is. Oh, and Dan going on a date with your guest doesn't surprise me. ;) He's happily married now with a beautiful baby girl. Talk soon! \n[Do you often follow strangers on Instagram?  Also, are you going to Pittsburgh in June?  If so, can you bring me some vinyl from your bands?  In addition, if question two is true you should buy a nice pair if shoes before hand (and maybe cut your hair \ud83d\ude2c\\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhbzl4?context=5)|HA! I do follow strangers! @whoisryanwalker and yes I think I will be in Pittsburgh in June. #BlackandYellow BTW, why should I buy a nice pair of shoes? \n[When did you first start playing music?  Was the keyboard your first and only instrument you have played?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc1ik?context=5)|When I was 12. My band was called Monkey Meets the Banana. We hit Vista, CA up with stickers all over town. I started on guitar and eventually moved to other instruments. Thanks for asking! \n[Why do you think there has been such an explosion of generic radio friendly corporate \"rock\" bands over the last decade?  Do you think it has to  do with the industry being driven more by singles and less by albums because of the digital revolution or do you have another theory?  Is hard rock (i.e. bands like Zepplin, Nirvana, etc\\) as a popular cultural phenomenon dead now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhukj7?context=5)|I think there has always been corporate radio friendly rock music. At least on some kind of level. The music industry is always evolving and changing. I can only imagine where things will be in another ten years.. singles vs full albums, downloads vs steaming. I really see downloads becoming less and less over the years to come as streaming sites like Spotify and Beats music keep growing. Leaving a major gap in sells and royalties for artists. I think the new Nirvana's are bands like Cage The Elephant & Tame Impala. My buddy @socialsoundsystem has his ears to the industry if you would ever like to pick his brain. Rock on! \n[Hey, Ryan! I saw you play with Dragons 3 times in 2013. Amazing every time. I was in the front row of the Orlando show in September and it was the best show I've ever had the pleasure of attending. I met you and the rest of the guys after the show and you were all nothing but humble and kind. Mac even helped me in completing my collection of the band's work (it's grown pretty out of control at this point\\). Anyway, thanks for the amazing memories. I hope there's another tour soon, I've been craving to see a few more shows! Anyway, that aside. What's your funniest memory during the Night Visions tours? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhesmc?context=5)|That would probably have to be Ben walking out in his underwear on stage during the support band's final song/set of tour. Atlas Genius, X Ambassadors, etc. \n[Ryan! I met you at a coffee shop before a concert last spring in Minneapolis. You gave my 2 tickets to the sold out show and then we then barhopped after the concert with my friend and that girl Katie that worked at The Varsity (you knew her previously\\). That was one of the best nights of my college career and still one of my favorite stories to tell :\\) Thanks for being so chill and open to hanging out with people you don't even know!  2 questions: 1\\) Do you remember that? and 2\\) What is your favorite city that you visited on tour?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc5dh?context=5)|I remember that!

Actually, Platz is the only one who won't prank. We talk sports rather than hit bars. ;) \n[You mentioned listening to The Beach Boys in that Tweet. Now may I ask for your favorite Beach Boys song, album, member, and lyric? In addition, do you feel the aforementioned group has had any sort of influence on them Dragons? Thank you for your time Mr. Walker.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chheefd?context=5)|Nothing to do with Imagine Dragons and mores Dreamers.

I'm finding myself steering away from pictures etc. I rarely get recognized when I'm in public and thats a really nice thing. It's amazing that I can have that kind of freedom and still support a really hot band like Imagine Dragons. When I am recognized I don't mind talking with fans and taking pictures... I'll stick around and chat as long as they want. I like interacting with everyone. It's enjoyable to me. In my mind nothing really separates me from a fan. I guess I just don't see myself as someone who is famous.\n[Ryan, care to explain where you learned to give such awesome hugs??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25hxo7/iama_ryan_walker_touring_member_of_imagine/chhc3rr?context=5)|From fans like you! \n[When you were a child, what profession you wanted have?
