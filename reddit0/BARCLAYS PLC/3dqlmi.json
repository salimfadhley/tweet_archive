It&#39;s an unfortunate, and helpless, position I am in due to a &quot;colossal f**k up&quot; by Barclays PLC.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\n20/7/2015 9:28 My account is now back to normal :) ... <a href=\"http://imgur.com/g7DoS76\">http://imgur.com/g7DoS76</a></p>\n\n<p>20/7/2015 15:40 Had a call from Barclay&#39;s. They confirmed this as a technical glitch and said they will put 150 pound into my account as an appology.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone on Reddit who helped to solve this. I really appreciate it &lt;3</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>This morning I checked my online banking. I&#39;m with Barclays. Both my normal account and savings accounts were suddenly in a huge amount of debt :</p>\n\n<p>Normal account: -\u20a499995</p>\n\n<p>Savings account: -\u20a499681</p>\n\n<p>Screenshot of my online banking: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/XTH0OUQ\">http://imgur.com/XTH0OUQ</a></p>\n\n<p>Photo of balance slip from cash machine: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/VjUU6zT\">http://imgur.com/VjUU6zT</a> (sorry best image I could get, but can be seen)</p>\n\n<p>My account is a basic account. I can not have an overdraft. I have a Visa chip and pin, but it&#39;s a basic account. My savings account has a card, but I can only use it in Barclays. It&#39;s not a Visa. The bank wouldn&#39;t even allow my account to go into  \u20a410 debt, let alone \u20a4200k!</p>\n\n<p>I thought this was an online error. I thought maybe their site was acting up. I went to the cashpoint and was shocked when the cashpoint said I was nearly 100 grand in debt!</p>\n\n<p>At this point I went straight into the bank and asked them to check both accounts. The cashier confirmed they were both in debt by nearly 100k. But couldn&#39;t explain why.</p>\n\n<p>I sat with a Barclays advisor at the Halesowen Branch for over an hour whilst she tried to find out why so much money had been taken from my accounts. The advisor had to call the same numbers customers do ... which goes straight through to an Indian call centre. I was shocked that Barclay&#39;s own staff have to use the same call centres customers do. She confirmed they don&#39;t have direct numbers to UK call centres!</p>\n\n<p>The advisor was passed from pillar to post. She was cut off by one of the call centres because they didn&#39;t know how to deal with my account. So we had to start the whole process again!</p>\n\n<p>I was told that the transactions were &quot;forced&quot; on their system. I don&#39;t know what this means though. They said they were card transactions. Really ...for 100k each, even though one account is just a basic Barclays card?</p>\n\n<p>In the end the bank closed, and I have to go back in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>All my money is in those accounts. I rely on this money to feed my family! Because I&#39;m in 100k debt in both accounts I can&#39;t access my money. I explained this to the advisor in Barclays but her line manager had went home so nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not even rich. I have Aspergers and I claim ESA as I&#39;m mentally unfit to work. So why would they take 200k from me, and then deny me access to the little money I have? They had no issues escorting me off the premisis at closing time knowing I had no money to buy food because of their error! We have a 7 year old too and I explained I need this money to live.</p>\n\n<p>Ps. sorry about the grammar error in the title.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n\n<p>17/07/2015 9.00am: It&#39;s 9am, and over 24 hours since my account was place in debt. My account is still in debt! I was hoping that it would have returned to normal today :( Off to the bank in a moment to see if I can get this sorted.</p>\n\n<p>17/7/2015 10.00am: Just came back from the bank. I have to go back in 30 minutes. Nobody knows what&#39;s going on. The code on the transaction is a BLT (or BTL). They&#39;re currently trying to figure out what this code means because they don&#39;t even know. They can&#39;t tell where the money went either. The branch staff have been awesome though in trying to resolve this. Still no access to my money though :(</p>\n\n<p>17/7/2015 10:58am: Been back to the bank. They&#39;re currently sending emails to other colleagues higher up to see if they can take a look at it. At the moment I&#39;m in limbo, and I&#39;m still not allowed access to my money. Just sitting around now waiting for the bank manager to call me. It was pointless sitting around in the bank as he wasn&#39;t certain when they would respond.</p>\n\n<p>17/7/2015 11:41am: Contacted the Financial Ombudsman to see if they can sort this. Their response ... they can&#39;t really do anything. They will start the complaint, but the bank has 8 weeks to respond. </p>\n\n<p>I explained my situation, and I asked if this would be considered an exceptional case and asked if she could do anything to speed it up. She said she would email the bank regarding the complaint immediately to try speed things up. She admitted though, at this stage the FO is powerless. I have gone through with the complaint and got my reference number.</p>\n\n<p>My concern is it&#39;s now 1.25pm, and nobody has called. I&#39;ve been to the bank so many times I feel worried that I&#39;m just an annoyance to them now. There&#39;s nothing more they can do except wait. If this isn&#39;t sorted today then I&#39;m left with nothing over the weekend :( My electric just ran out too! I hope to God they sort this today and not leave it until Monday!</p>\n\n<p>I have explained all of this to the people at the bank.

The other money that was in my account I am not allowed. I think by law they have to make the benefits available. My other money is still tied up. They still can&#39;t confirm what&#39;s going on, or what has gone wrong. This is not solved. Far from it. My account is still stuck in debt and I am not allowed to access any money that&#39;s not from benefits. So my savings are stuck.</p>\n\n<p>At least I have money over the weekend, that&#39;s something.</p>\n\n<p>17/7/2015 3:27: Got the benefits money. Was denied the rest of my cash. Nobody knows when it will be sorted, or what&#39;s happened. I will keep this updated when I hear something.
