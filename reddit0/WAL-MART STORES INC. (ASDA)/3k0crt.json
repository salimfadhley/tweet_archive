They said the item just needs to be sold and shipped by Amazon. However, they double checked with their head manager who said it cannot have prime as well. \n\n\nI was showing the price in the Amazon app, so I exited and then pulled it up on my browser with no account signed in while waiting for the manager. When you search an item, it'll say prime on the overview list, but when you specifically click that item, the prime will be gone but will still say sold and shipped by Amazon. And there you go, price matched with no problem!\n\nTL;DR\n\nDon't open amazon in the app when price matching at Wal-Mart, open in an incognito window or your browser with no account logged in instead, and the prime logo will not be visible on the item page!
