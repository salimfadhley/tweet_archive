I am absolutely astounded at the cost of bikes in this city, like I literally can't believe how much you pay for bikes here. Where is the cheapest place to get good quality bikes (ie ultegra group set carbon frame)? All the LBS' I've been in to the prices are not even reasonable and Evans and Halfords are a joke. \n\nLet me know what you think? \n\nAlso is it worth going to continental europe to get a bike?\n\nCheers for listening to my rant / giving me advice.",
