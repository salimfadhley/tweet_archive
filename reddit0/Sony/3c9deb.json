  "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience with PS4 Out-of-Service Warranty.\n\nMy PS4 stopped working in the beginning of May.  It would not fully power on, I'd get about 1 second of power before it turned itself off.  On May 13th, I submitted my PS4 for out-of-service warranty which costs $149.  Yeah, it stinks, but $149 seemed reasonable to get a refurb system.  \n\nSony uses Fedex to do the shipping, and it is about the slowest shipping service I have ever seen, taking about a week for my PS4 to make it from Oregon to their service center in Texas.  From there, it took another ~15 days (June 4th) for them to send me back a refurb PS4.  I finally received my refurb PS4 on June 13th.  Total processing time + shipping: 1 Month.\n\nI also checked my credit card statement, and it turns out they billed me $149 two times.  To this day, they have not refunded me the accidental charge.  I have escalated it to their customer service management, and sent them a copy of my Credit Card Bill with the duplicate charges.  10 Days later, and I have heard nothing in response about getting a charge back for their error.  Money is tight this month, and my CC bill is due on the 11th.  I always try to pay in full, but might not be able to this month.  \n\nSummary - Be careful sending in your PS4.  They are very slow in processing your repair, use the slowest shipping, and must be prone to errors in billing customers.  I'm really disappointed.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nUPDATE:  Alright - I filed a complaint with the BBB. I also posted my story for them to twitter: https://twitter.com/oaklandraider86/status/618044872142909441[1]\nThanks everybody!  If I don't hear back by Thursday, I'm doing a CC Chargeback\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nUPDATE2:  Still no word from Sony - I appreciate the support.  I was hoping to return home today to an email from someone on their CS team based on the big thread here.  A few of you have asked if I am sure if this was a duplicate charge (or just an outstanding hold on my CC); it is a duplicate charge. [CC BILL](http://i.imgur.com/Yjm8B3v.jpg)",
