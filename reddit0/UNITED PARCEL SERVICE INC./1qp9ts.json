Something that has a compelling and material effect (and is legal).\n\nWe've organized before and made a difference with issues like SOPA. This is no different but time is an important factor to get enough people on board and raise a chorus of voices against this corporate engineered Faustian pact.\n\nI realize these are disparate ideas. A cohesive strategy is needed but it starts by just throwing shit against the wall and seeing what sticks. Anyone with strong organizational expertise should definitely chime in.\n\nAny ideas are welcome. Even things that sound dumb can turn out to be genius so share your thoughts.\n\n\nEDITS: My thinking so far (again just uncensored thinking):\n\n* Organizing online boycotts (this is an important sales season)\n\n* Engage organizations already working against TPP and lend support\n\n* Engaging major movers of web traffic to suspend their services for a period in solidarity.\n\n* Splatter YouTube with personal videos themed \"How the TPP will affect me\"  making clear the impact will reach every household\n\n* Contacting the office of the United States Trade Representative en masse (correspondence@ustr.eop.gov)\n\n* Networking to provide organizers of street protests with resources or more boots on the ground\n\n* Create web comix, image macs, printable T-shirt designs.\n\n* Include anti TPP messages in Torrents.\n\n* Downloadable stencils and designs for \"reverse graffiti\"\n\n* Door to door leafleting.\n\n* Ensure communications are at designed for people of various reading levels and educations. This would also mean creating  '  \n   tailored methods of reaching them.\n\n* Distribute a Freeware STOP TPP-themed game\n\n* Encourage people to write STOP TPP in grease pencil on their car windows. Help it catch on.\n\n* Distribute Anti-TPP labeled condoms at colleges and places where people gather. \"To protect yourself when you get fucked\" ;)\n\n* Expressing loud support for members of congress or candidates for office facing incumbents who voice opposition to TPP.\n\n* Organize \"phone-call tsunamis\" to political office holders. Just keep the phone ringing until someone's ears bleed.\n\n* Foment opposition through information campaigns in signatory countries to pressure their governments not to cave to U.S.  \n  demands for draconian IP concessions.\n\n* Enlist the support of large internet companies who will be forced to play \"internet cop\" (for ex. Google) under draft rules to \n  leverage their influence in congress against ratification of the treaty.\n\n* Create parodies of USTR social media accounts.
