We are IBM Researcher Dr. James Wynne, and Yale University Professor Michael Frame and we worked with <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Ehwy4Gq27uY\">Benoit Mandelbrot</a>, The Father of Fractals, in the days he pioneered fractal geometry. Here\u2019s proof it\u2019s us: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/BKBm4\">http://imgur.com/a/BKBm4</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr James Wynne (jjwynne) will be answering your questions from 10am to 12pm EST</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I arrived at the IBM Watson Research Center in 1971, my manager pointed out several established people who were the &quot;best of the best.&quot; Benoit was one of those people. I made his acquaintance and grew to admire him. We became friend s around 1990, when I became heavily involved in technical education outreach to local K-12 schools. From 1990, through his official retirement from IBM in 1993, and until 2005, he kept an office at the Watson Research Center, and I was in regular contact with him. I think of Benoit quite often, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts of him via Reddit&#39;s AMA. </p>\n\n<p>For more on Dr Wynne:  <a href=\"http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jjwynne\">http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jjwynne</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yale University Professor Michael Frame (MIchaelFrame) will be answering your questions from 12pm to 2pm EST</strong></p>\n\n<p>I teach math at Yale, and worked with Benoit Mandelbrot for 20 years.  We ran summer workshops for high school and college teachers, wrote papers and edited a book together, and had great fun exploring the fractal world.  The best times were when Benoit posed an open-ended question and we explored possibilities.  With other scientists he had serious, professional interactions.  But when it was just the two of us, we were little kids exploring the wide world around us.  Benoit showed me that above all else, science should be fun. </p>\n\n<p>For more on Professor Frame:  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz8NJ7ZVXwQ\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz8NJ7ZVXwQ</a></p>\n\n<p>To celebrate Benoit Mandelbrot and his contributions to science, technology and mathematics, IBM brought us together to answer your questions.
