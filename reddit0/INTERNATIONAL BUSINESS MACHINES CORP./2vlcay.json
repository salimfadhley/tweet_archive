I&#39;ve been at IBM for just over a year and it seems like nothing ever gets done. There are so many processes and so many groups it seems like a 1 month project can take an eternity to complete.  Once you figure out the process and navigate the never ending approval channels the process changes.  There are a lot of smart people, but I feel like information is never shared. Coming into an existing project nothing was ever done correctly and now it&#39;s 3 times as hard to backtrack and figure anything out. Work goes through so many different locations that don&#39;t know any specifics nor do they care to. I get the feeling that no one really knows anything.
