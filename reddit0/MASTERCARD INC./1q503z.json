After the promotional months (6 months) it's 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. I really feel this should be my main card and the Scene Visa my secondary for whenever i go to the movies (get more points when spent at movies). \n\nI've heard I shouldn't cancel my Oldest card. Is this true? In that case, should I activate the amazon card, order what I want with the $15 credit and cancel it? Is the MBNA card worth it? What's the impact of cancelling my TD Visa or Amazon or any of these cards? I don't know what to do but I don't want to end up with 5 cards!",
