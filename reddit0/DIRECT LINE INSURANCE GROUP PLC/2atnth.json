These stories are a snapshot of what I put up with to rent them:\n\nMe: \"...and I will need your driver's license, credit card, and current proof of insurance.\"\n\nCustomer: *starts reading off his driver's license information*\n\nM: \"Sir, I need to see that card so I can enter the information.\"\n\nC: I can read it to you.\n\nM: \"yes, I understand that, but I need to visually verify that it is current.\"\n\nC: It's current.\n\nM: [getting reasonably irked] \"Sir, you are renting a vehicle.

Can't I just buy it from you?\n\nM: No, we need to have your insurance to cover any collision damage to the truck if there is an accident.\n\nC: I on't have insurance because I don't have a car.
