He studied Wing Chun under Yip Man at the age of 13. He moved back to the US at 18 years old due to excessive fights with rival gangs and studied Philosophy at the University of Washington.</p>\n\n<p>After a dissatisfying fight against a Choy Li Fut man in 1964, he revamped his fighting style, incorporating heavy weight training and tactics, moves and strategies from other arts, such as fencing, judo, jiu-jitsu, karate, and western boxing. During the late 1960&#39;s, Bruce trained Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, and Mike Stone, who were the top karate competitors of the time, collectively having won every major karate tournament in the US. When he damaged a spinal nerve while weight training in 1970 and was bed-ridden for six months, he put on paper his ideas and philosophy for his martial art, Jeet Kune Do, the Way of the Intercepting Fist.</p>\n\n<p>He passed away on July 20, 1973 due to a hypersensitive reaction to some medication for a headache which caused an increase of the fluids in the brain. He starred in five major films: The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972), Way of the Dragon (1972), Enter the Dragon (1973), and The Game of Death (posthumous).</p>\n\n<h3>Physical Fitness</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Some guys may not believe it, but I spent hours perfecting whatever I did.&quot;<br/>\n-Bruce Lee</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gfycat.com/ThirdInfantileHairstreakbutterfly\">The Lat Spread</a> - (WotD) Bruce was renowned for his enormous latissimus dorsi muscles.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://gfycat.com/UnevenScalyKillifish\">The Lat Spread 2: Electric Boogaloo</a> - (WotD) Before the fight with Chuck Norris, Bruce stretches his forearms then displays his front lat spread.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/OJpctwH.jpg\">Shredded</a> - He was shredded in every picture and his abs were legendary.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://gfycat.com/DistortedEducatedDunnart\">Shirtless and Slow motion</a> - (EtD) Bruce looking ripped killing some dude in slow motion.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/UPAjOIh.jpg\">V-Sit</a> - (GoD) Image of Bruce Lee performing an elevated V-Sit, an advanced bodyweight exercise.

Now let's stop about here. Is it that simple to become a star? Well, I can assure you it's not that simple.*  \n\n>*Also, I can tell you as more Bruce Lee's films are shown,* **the audience will soon realize, not only in acting ability but in physical skill as well, they will see the difference**. *For example, in the Way of the Dragon, my skill is matched with an American champion, Chuck Norris, who happens to be a 7-time winner of both the All-Time American Open and World Karate Championship as well. Then there is Bob Wall, the 1970 Heavyweight Karate Champion, plus Hwang In-shik, the seventh degree Hapkido expert, which some audience have seen him in the film called 'Hapkido'.* **'Of course, it is only movie-making', people will say. But I'm sure that the audience are not so insensitive as to not be able to see and judge by themselves and compare these men's speed, power, rhythm, coordination, versatilities, etc., etc.**\"  \n>*-Bruce Lee*",
