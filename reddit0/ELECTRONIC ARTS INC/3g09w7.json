Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., concerning the right of publicity. Specifically, the court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution \u201cdo not immunize the news media from civil liability when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent.\u201d Although the case in question concerned a circus performer launched from a cannonball, the ruling would soon have huge ramifications pertaining to the sports video-game industry. The 1977 decision did not draw a precise line to define where First Amendment rights ended and a \u201cright of publicity\u201d began \u2013 and 15 years later, a fledgling company named Electronic Arts Inc. would take advantage of the ruling to release Bill Walsh College Football on the Super NES. Electronic Arts (later EA Games) would soon become embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA over the extent of \u201cright of publicity\u201d. At issue were television broadcasts of the games in which the athletes had played, and video games using near-lifelike \u201cavatars\u201d of the collegians, with their feats open to manipulation by the players. The NCAA had long held that athletes\u2019 status as amateurs precluded them from negotiating their appearance in the media and on video-games; this would soon change as the profitability of the sport skyrocketed. \n\n[Formation of the CFA](http://newsok.com/exploring-the-history-of-college-football-media-rights/article/3875459)\n\n[SHOWDOWN: CFA faces NCAA in Federal Court](https://web.archive.org/web/20140313170153/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124683/index.htm)\n\nOver the course of the 1977 season, fewer than 1 in 5 varsity football teams made enough revenue to cover operating expenses. But to the outside observer, the sport couldn\u2019t be richer. Following their victory in the 1978 Cotton Bowl, Notre Dame received a $1 million payout \u2013 becoming the first school ever to collect $1 million for a single game. The majority of this money was immediately allocated towards the completion of a multi-million dollar sports and convocation center, as well as the installation of synthetic turf on its football fields. NCAA revenues sat at $6.6 million during the year, and the continuing influx of money led to an increasing conflict over football revenue allocations between the powerful football conferences and the weaker Division I teams. The formation of the College Football Association (CFA) in 1977 represented the zenith of the first stage of this conflict. An alliance of 64 major college football programs (excluding the PAC-10 and Big Ten), the CFA\u2019s goal was to sell television rights independently of the NCAA \u2013 under NCAA rules at the time, any team that did not appear on an NCAA-approved telecast would face suspension/expulsion from the organization. Four years after its creation, the CFA would accomplish this with a massive four-year, $180 million deal with NBC. And in three years further, this would lead to a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the NCAA and set in motion the wheels of conference realignment. \n\n**[Bob Vorhies\u2019 Brutal Run to Death](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1978/02/19/page/1/article/a-teens-rutal-run-to-death/index.html)**\n\n[Looking Back: Was Bob Vorhies Killed by Discipline?](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&dat=19780101&id=RYwfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J9MEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1287,89142&hl=en)\n\nWhen Jerome Vorhies opened his mail that fateful day, he found an incomplete transcript for his son Bob\u2019s first college semester. At the bottom was this notation: \n\n**RESIGNED EFFECTIVE 11-21-77 \u2013 Bob Vorhies died on Nov. 21, 1977** \n\nA stunned Vorhies was subsequently informed that his son, freshman FB Bob Vorhies, had died shortly after being ordered to undergo a severe workout drill by Virginia Tech assistant coach Marvin Baker, as punishment for the discovery of a bottle of beer in Vorhies\u2019 room the previous day. The drill had reportedly included the following exercises:\n\n> \u201cTen 50-yard sprints followed by ten 100-yard sprints, with both the sprint and return to the starting line to be completed in 30 seconds. Fifty push-ups. Fifty sit-ups. Two-hundred yard bear crawls, four more 100-yard runs, and an undetermined number of laps around the field.\u201d \u2013 William Taaffe, *Washington Star*\n\nDuring the drills, Baker was alone with Vorhies, the rest of the team having returned to the dormitories. Following the punishment, an exhausted Vorhies returned to the dormitories, too tired to remove the athletic tape from his ankles. He stumbled into bed, went to sleep\u2026 and never woke up. A subsequent report by the medical examiner\u2019s office concluded that Vorhies had died from a cardiac arrhythmia, with no determined underlying cause.\n\n> *The thing I can\u2019t shake from my mind is the irony of it all. Here was this incredibly disciplined kid who worked his backside off getting killed by discipline itself. If you give me five of the best athletes in the country and let me run them the way they ran him, I\u2019d kill four of them, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d \u2013 Track coach Bob Radecke\n\nVorheis\u2019 death prompted a $14 million lawsuit by the freshman\u2019s grief-stricken parents against a \u201cstubborn and recalcitrant\u201d administration at Virginia Tech. Bowing to heavy media pressure, the VT Athletic Association fired head coach Jimmy Sharpe that year but maintained that the drills were not the cause of the death. In 1981, after a grand jury cleared the university of any criminal wrongdoing, Tech reached a settlement with the Vorhies\u2019 family. Part of the settlement was a written promise that athletes at Virginia Tech would never be ordered to undergo punishment drills as severe as those administered to Bob Vorhies again.\n\n[Four years after tragedy, Virginia Tech to curb disciplinary drills](http://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/21/sports/va-tech-to-curb-disciplinary-drills.html)\n***\n\n**Rule Changes**\n\n* **Offensive linemen are now allowed to block downfield when receiver catches the ball behind the neutral zone.** This allows linemen to charge ahead of a screen pass to set up blocks.

The Irish were also awarded the [Grantland Rice Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/E2bjKm7.jpg) by the *Football Writers\u2019 Association of America.*\n\n**Notre Dame Voted National Champions**\n\n> ASSOCIATED PRESS \u2013 Less than three months after critics were clamoring for his scalp and \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were flourishing in South Bend, Ind., Notre Dame coach Dan Devine is having the last laugh and basking in the glow of college football's national championship. The Fighting Irish, whose overall winning percentage of .774 entering the 1977 campaign was the best in history, added another chapter to the Notre Dame legend Monday when they were voted national champions by the 64 voters in the nationwide Associated Press poll. In a race among five teams with identical 11-1 records, Notre Dame's 38-10 Cotton Bowl rout of previously No. 1- rated Texas enabled the Irish to win out over Alabama, Arkansas, Texas and Perm State. \n\n> \"There's a lot of personal satisfaction in a job well done and maybe this is hard to understand but I'm happier for the team than for myself,\" Devine said when he was informed that Notre Dame had won the AP National Championship Trophy. \"I have a combined feeling of being humble and thankful. I usually try to hold my emotions in, but I'm kind of quivering all over right now. I'm just so thankful that my staff and my players are the kind of people they are.\" Notre Dame, which finished the regular season in fifth place, received 371.3 first-place votes \u2014 one voter split his ballot among Notre Dame, Alabama and Arkansas \u2014 and 1,180 of a possible 1,280 points. Runner-up Alabama, a convincing 35-6 winner over Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, climbed from third place to second with 191.3 first-place ballots and 1,132 points. Texas, the only team in the country to make it through the regular season undefeated, dropped to fourth place with the remaining two first-place votes and 797 points.\n\n**Coaches Award Notre Dame National Title**\n\n> NEW YORK (UPI) - When Notre Dame was upset by Mississippi in its second game of the season, Dan Devine faced the biggest challenge of his coaching career. The Fighting Irish could not afford to drop another game and they needed for a couple of strong teams to do just that if they hoped to capture the national championship everyone picked them to win. But that\u2019s exactly the way it worked out in the improbable finish to the college football season. Notre Dame, the preseason favorite to win the national championship, fulfilled the prediction Tuesday when the United Press International Board of Coaches named the Fighting Irish the nation\u2019s No. 1 team in the final ratings. The Irish, who embarrassed previously undefeated Texas 38-10 in the Cotton Bowl Monday, received 23 first-place votes and 365 points from the 39 members of the coaches\u2019 board who participated in the voting.\n\n> Alabama, which routed Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, was a close second, only 11 points behind Notre Dame. Alabama received 13 first place votes and 354 points and Arkansas finished third with two first place mentions and 310 points. \u201cAfter the loss to Mississippi. I felt it was a real challenge,\u201d said Devine, whose future at Notre Dame seemed in jeopardy prior to the Cotton Bowl victory. \u201cIt was a challenge to myself and our staff and our players. Along the way you\u2019re going to face challenges no matter what job you\u2019re in. If you stay in coaching long enough you\u2019re going to have bad starts and bad moments. It just depends on how you react to those bad things.\u201d\n\n***\n\n**Statistical Leaders**\n\nCategory | Team | Average | Category | Team | Average\n--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------\nRushing Offense | [](#f/oklahoma)Oklahoma | 328.9 ypg | Rushing Defense | [](#f/jacksonstate) Jackson State | 67.8 ypg\nPassing Offense | [](#f/byu) Brigham Young | 341.6 ypg | Passing Defense | [](#f/tennesseestate) Tennessee State | 67.9 ypg\nTotal Offense | [](#f/colgate) Colgate | 486.1 ypg | Total Defense | [](#f/jacksonstate) Jackson State | 207.0 ypg\nScoring Offense | [](#f/gramblingstate) Grambling | 42.0 ppg | Scoring Defense | [](#f/northcarolina) North Carolina | 7.4 ppg\n\n***\n\n**Notable Games**\n\n* **September 17th**: [](#f/nebraska) Nebraska def.

HUSKERS DAZZLE CRIMSON TIDE**\n\n> LINCOLN \u2013 If Nebraska's Tom Osborne had a conservative image before, he erased that label with a series of bold coaching decisions on the way to a 31-24 victory over Alabama in Memorial Stadium Saturday afternoon. The Cornhusker coach dazzled a sellout crowd of 75,899 by ordering three trick plays during a single touchdown drive \u2013 an I-back pass, another on which half the NU team seemed to handle the ball, and a fake field goal for the score. Later, facing a fourth-and-short yardage decision near the 'Bama goal line with the score tied, Osborne spurned a cinch field goal. Hick Berns responded by diving over a mass of bodies in the line to produce the final margin of victory. \"You have your heart in your throat when you call a play like that,\" the Husker coach admitted. \"But there was still a lot of time left in the game, and I wasn't sure a field goal would produce enough points to hold up. A touchdown would force them to score to beat us.\u201d The strategy paid off. Fabled 'Bama coach Bear Bryant's Crimson Tide was forced into throwing long passes (something wishbone teams don't like to do) and Husker cornerback Jim Pillen picked off two of those aerials to preserve the victory.\n \n> Nebraska cornerback Ted Harvey set the tempo by picking off \u2018Bama quarterback Jeff Rutledge's toss on Alabama's first play of the game. This enabled Nebraska to move within range for a 29-yard field goal by Billy Todd to give the Huskers a quick 3-0 lead. Alabama came right back to take a 7-3 lead, marching 91 yards in 10 plays. The touchdown was set up by a 33-yard gainer after Rutledge handed off to running back Tony Nathan, who then lateraled the ball back to the Bama quarterback. He then passed to all-American split end Ozzie Newsome. Worried Nebraska fans were immediately set straight by a Husker offense that started popping clever plays for huge hunks of yardage to regain the lead with a 80-yard march. Husker frontman Tom Sorley's 30-yard pass to Curtis Craig was one of the big plays in the Husker drive and was set up by a dazzling maneuver in which the ball switched hands three times before Sorley wound up throwing 11 yards to tight end Ken Spaeth. When the Huskers appeared to be bogged down with three yards to go on fourth down at the Alabama seven, Osborne sent in Todd again. Backup quarterback Randy Garcia lined up as the holder, but took the snap and pitched to Berns at the goal line for a surprise touchdown. Alabama, which had rolled along on Rutledge's passes, wheeled 73 yards in 12 plays to push in front again, 14-10. The second march by the visitors was a blend of running and passing \u2014 a 12-yard run by Major Ogilvie, 30 yards in four trips by Johnny Davis and two completions by Rutledge good for 25 yards being the chief ingredients. Back came the Huskers, rolling 80 yards in six plays. Garcia came on for an injured Sorley and promptly connected on a pass of 53 yards, and Berns went over the top from the two. Alabama probed to the Nebraska 21 late in the second quarter before Roger Chapman made a 37-yard field goal to make it 17-17 at intermission.\n\n> Lee Kunz picked off a Rutledge throw three minutes into the second half and returned it six yards to the Alabama 39 to set up the touchdown that gave Nebraska a 24-17 lead. Berns romped over right guard for 22 yards, then Craig wheeled 17 yards around right end for the points, bowling over a defender just outside the goal line. Alabama didn't get rolling again until late in the third quarter and finally covered 55 yards in 12 plays for a 24-24 tie. Rutledge passes to Newsome, and Neal accounted for 32 yards and Nathan finally soared over the top for the score. The Huskers responded with a drama-packed, 80-yard drive that culminated with Berns soaring over the top of the Alabama line for the final yard on fourth down for the winning points, holding the ball high in triumph. That bright moment for the Nebraska offense came with 7:12 left, plenty of time for Alabama, which ground out 430 yards to 417 for Nebraska in the game. But Pillen twice came up with big interceptions and finally reserve quarterback Kevin Jones of Alabama pitched an incomplete pass on the final play of the game from his own 37-yard line.\n\n* **September 24th**: [](#f/oklahoma)#3 Oklahoma def. [](#f/ohiostate)#4 Ohio State, **29-28** \n\nFrom *The Lubbock Journal*: **LAST-SECOND FG LIFTS OU TO DRAMATIC WIN**\n\n> COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - If Barry Switzer were a baseball manager, he would have said that a game isn't over until the last out. But Switzer is a football coach, so he put it this way; \"Football games are 60 minutes, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Yes they are, and Switzer's third-ranked Sooners used up 59 minutes and 57 seconds of the allotted time before pulling out an incredible 29-28 triumph over fourth-ranked Ohio State on Uwe von Schamann's 41-yard field goal with three seconds remaining. Switzer called that decisive field goal \"one of the greatest plays I have ever seen in football\u201d but said it was \"a miracle\" that Oklahoma recovered an onside kickoff following Elvis Peacock\u2019s two-yard touchdown run with 1:29 to play. It was the first meeting between two of college football\u2019s traditional powers and it had plenty of everything \u2014scoring, mistakes, and excitement. Oklahoma burst to a shocking 20-0 lead early in the second quarter, fell behind 28-20 by turning the ball over six times, and then salvaged victory in the closing seconds. Ohio State's Woody Hayes, who vented his anger by hurling equipment on the sidelines in the dying minutes and then slapped an Oklahoma student manager as he left the field, was far from thrilled. \"I thought we had it won and then we didn't. We practice against an offside kickoff damn near every day and we worked on it three days this week. I don't think the kick went 10 yards but it doesn\u2019t have to since we touched it!\u201d said an irate Hayes afterwards.\n\n> Switzer had said his Sooners \u201clead the universe in turnovers,\" and all that charity gave them the astounding total of 19 turnovers in three game. But ironically, it was a fumble by OSU\u2019s second-string quarterback Greg Castignola with 6:24 remaining that swung the tide back to Oklahoma after the fourth-ranked Buckeyes had surged to a 28-20 lead by playing error-free football since early in the game. The Sooners stormed 43 yards in 13 plays for a clutch touchdown after Dave Hudgens separated Castignola from the ball and Keggie Kinlaw recovered at the Ohio State 43. The Buckeyes turned back a two-point conversion run by Peacock. But Oklahoma was successful on an onside kick which everybody knew was coming, and smartly moved into position for the winning field goal, which the West Berlin-born von Schamann booted with a 15-mile-an-hour wind at his back. \n\n> Oklahoma had stunned the huge crowd, along with an ABC-TV audience, by taking a 17-0 lead in the opening period. The Sooners scored on a 23-yard dash by Peacock, Billy Simms' 14-yard run after Ohio State fumbled at its 16, and the first of three field goals by von Schamann. Then, Oklahoma not only got away with its first fumble of the game but scored a touchdown. Quarterback Thomas Lott lost the ball, but it was inadvertently kicked about 10 yards by Ohio State defensive end Paul Ross and bounced directly into Peacock's hands at the 23. Quarterback Rod Gerald's slick scrambling and Ron Springs' 30-yard touchdown run got Ohio State on the scoreboard early in the second period, and the Buckeyes were right back in the game at 20-14 just 36 seconds later when Gerald scored on a 19-yard keeper. It came on the very first play after David Adkins recovered a fumble by Peacock. Ohio State's first scoring drive covered 80 yards, but the other three were relatively short ones of 19 yards following Peacock's fumble, 48 yards -- including two crucial penalties against Oklahoma for pass interference and illegal procedure -- after a quick kick ,and 33 yards after Kelton Dansler intercepted the first pass the Sooners threw. Despite all its generosity, Oklahoma survived fumbles at its 20 and 33 in the second period, another lost fumble at its 22 on the first play of the second half, and a second interception late in the third quarter.\n\n* **October 8th**:[](#f/texas) #5 Texas def. [](#f/oklahoma)#2 Oklahoma, **13-6**\n\nFrom *The Odessa American*: **FORGOTTEN QUARTERBACK LEADS \u2018HORNS TO UPSET VICTORY**\n\n> DALLAS (AP) - Randy McEachern watched last year\u2019s Texas-Oklahoma football game from the press box where he spotted for a radio network, but he bounced off the bench Saturday to inspire the fifth-ranked Longhorns to a 13-6 upset of second-ranked Oklahoma. Third-string McEachern was such an unknown quantity that he was not even listed in Texas\u2019 media guide. But after injuries felled Texas\u2019 first two quarterbacks in the 1st quarter, McEachern displayed all the aplomb of a hardened veteran and may have earned himself a battlefield letter. \u201cSure, I was scared,\u201d said McEachern, whose timely passing set up tailback Earl Campbell\u2019s devastating runs. \"This was pretty nerve-wrecking. Coach Akers told me to be ready after our first quarterback went down, but I didn\u2019t think the second one would go down. I really didn\u2019t know what to think when he did. I never played in a big game like this.\u201d A tremendous goal line stand in the final four minutes sealed Texas\u2019 first victory over the Sooners since 1970. Tackle Brad Shearer and defensive back Johnnie Johnson tackled Oklahoma quarterback Thomas Lott for no gain on fourth-and-one at the Texas 5. Russell Erxleben kicked field goals of 64 and 58 yards with his shotgun place-kicking leg. \n\n> Texas was stunned in the first period when both first-string quarterback Mark McBath and second-string signal caller Jon Aune suffered injuries. The underdog Longhorns, trailing 3-0 after Oklahoma\u2019s Uwe Von Schamann kicked a 47-yard field goal, appeared doomed with the unheralded McEachern taking the field before the sellout crowd of 72,000 in the Cotton Bowl. McEachern drove Texas into position for Erxleben\u2019s 64-yard field goal to tie the game 3-3. Then he whipped the Longhorns on an 80-yard drive sprinkled with bullseye passes and Campbell\u2019s thundering runs. Campbell scored from 24 yards out behind Steve Hall\u2019s crushing block as Texas led 10-3 at halftime. Von Schamann kicked a 33-yard field goal to make it 10-6 in the third period, but Erxleben matched it with a 58-yarder in the fourth quarter. It was Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer\u2019s first loss to a Texas team and the first time Texas had defeated the Sooners since 1970. The game marked the debut of new Texas coach Freddy Akers in the series.\n\n> Earl Campbell, who spend most of last season sidelined with injuries, was the driving force for the Longhorns as he gouged out 124 tough yards on 23 carries against the hard-tackling Sooner defense. Texas went into the game averaging 61 points as the nation\u2019s No. 1 offensive team, but could not produce a first down until early in the second quarter with McEachern at the helm. He completed four of eight passes for 57 yards and kept the Sooners off balance with his perfectly timed pitches to Campbell running out of the Veer and I formations. Meanwhile the Longhorns defense, No. 1 against scoring in the nation, continually mauled the Sooners\u2019 Wishbone offense. After the game, Barry Switzer said: \u201cI told Akers after the game \u2018I hope they win the rest of them and the national championship\u2019. They have a great, great football team. Campbell is just unbelievable and I told him I hope he wins the Heisman Trophy.\u201d\n\n* **October 8th**: [](#f/alabama) #7 Alabama def. [](#f/usc)#1 Southern California, **21-20**\n\nFrom the *Valley Morning Star*: **CRIMSON TIDE SHOCKS NO. 1 USC**\n\n> LOS ANGELES (AP) - Bear Bryant, looking a little worn from the tension following Alabama\u2019s dramatic 21-20 victory over top-ranked Southern California Saturday, glanced upward when asked about the contest between the two traditional college powers. \u201cI think we got a little help from upstairs,\u201d Bryant drawled. \u201cWe were lucky to get out of it. I\u2019ve never seen a team come back as strong as they did.\u201d Alabama halfback Tony Nathan ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns and the Crimson Tide withstood a furious rally by the Trojans in the final seven minutes, including stopping a two-point conversion try in the waning seconds. USC coach John Robinson said going for the 21-21 tie and kicking the extra point didn\u2019t enter his mind. \u201cI couldn\u2019t come in here and look my team in the face after going for a tie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou play to win the game. That\u2019s the only way.\u201d Bryant agreed, saying, \u201cI would have gone for the two points; you don\u2019t come into a football game for a tie, you come in for a win.\u201d Seventh-ranked Alabama had taken a 21-6 lead over Southern Cal early in the final period of the nationally-televised game, but USC quarterback Rob Hertel passed his team back in the waning moments. Hertel hit Calvin Sweeney with a 10-yard touchdown pass with 6.46 remaining, then passed to Mosi Tatupu for the two-point conversion that made it 21-14. Then, starting at his own 21- yard line, Hertel marched the Trojans to the Alabama 1-yard line, where fullback Lynn Cain swept end for the score with 39 seconds left to play. But this time, the USC two-point conversion failed as Barry Krauss intercepted Hertel\u2019s desperation pass to preserve the victory. The Trojans attempted an onside kick following their missed conversion, but Alabama\u2019s Rick Neal fell on the ball, then the Crimson Tide ran out the clock.\n\n> Fullback Johnny Davis had given Alabama a 7-3 lead in the third quarter when he slipped through the right side of the line for a one-yard touchdown on a fourth down play. The Trojans closed the gap to a point just before the third period ended, however, when Frank Jordan kicked his second field goal of the afternoon, a 23-yarder. The Crimson Tide defense had held Southern Cal, which had a first-and-goal but was unable to punch the ball over. Nathan then built Alabama\u2019s lead to 21-6, scoring on a one-yard run early in the final quarter, then tallying again on a 13-yard scamper moments later. The third Alabama touchdown was set up when defensive tackle Curtis McGriff intercepted a blocked Southern Cal pass at the Trojans\u2019 eight-yard line The Crimson Tide had the edge offensively in the opening half, but, stopped by their own errors and a stubborn USC defense, they fell behind 3-0 before the fireworks and drama began in the second half.\n\n* **October 22nd**: [](#f/notredame) #11 Notre Dame def. [](#f/usc)#5 Southern California, **49-19** \n\nFrom the *San Bernardino County Sun*: **NOTRE DAME HUMILIATES USC, 49-19**\n\n> SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 It took USC six weeks and a lot of hard work to get here. It took the Trojans exactly four minutes and 15 seconds to go down in flames. The only meaningful statistic in this game was 49-19. That is the score by which Notre Dame humiliated the Trojans Saturday afternoon, by their largest margin of defeat since a 51-0 loss to the Irish in 1966 at the Coliseum. You can stare at the stat sheet as long as your patience will allow, and it still won't tell you a thing. There were surprises. The Trojans ran better than most people expected (188 yards). And the Irish passed better than the Trojans. Quarterback Joe Montana completed 13 of 24 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns, both of them to tight end Ken MacAfee, who roamed the USC secondary unattended. USC's Rob Hertel completed just 12 of 29 and had two passes intercepted. One of them, by his own admission, was the turning point in the game. A lot will be made of the fact that the Irish played this game wearing kelly green jerseys, the first time they've worn anything but navy blue at home since 1958. Supposedly that gave them an added emotional incentive in front of their 59,075 screaming fans. Nonsense. The Irish could have showed up in drag and still beaten the tar out of the Trojans. \"Let's get underneath those jerseys,\" said Dan Devine, the Notre Dame coach. \"There's an awful lot of heart under those jerseys and these kids have performed all year to the best of their abilities. This is my most satisfying victory ever.\" It had to be. Devine has been under a lot of heat here, from press and public, since he took over for Ara Parseghain in 1975.\n\n> True, the Trojans had some bad breaks and the Irish had some luck. But the Irish made a lot of their own good fortune. USC fumbled, threw interceptions and dropped passes. So did Notre Dame. Yet the game was astonishingly uneven. Because, in the last 4:15 of the first half, the Trojans turned a 7-7 game into 22-7 for Notre Dame with two devastating turnovers. \"Because,\" said USC coach John Robinson, \"we got the hell kicked out of us. I hardly know where to begin. We made an unbelievable amount of mental errors, and I think that spelled our downfall. They beat us every possible way.\u201d MacAfee, with eight pass receptions for 97 yards, scored touchdowns on catches of 13 and 1-yards while Montana twice went over on a sneak from the 1-yard line. Sophomore fullback Dave Mitchell plunged 4 yards for Notre Dame's first score and defensive tackle Jay Case ran 30 yards for the other touchdown after Bob Golic blocked a punt by Southern California\u2019s Marty King. Notre Dame\u2019s last score came with 12 seconds to play on a 4-yard pass from Rusty Lisch to Kevin Hart. Irish defensive back Tom Burgmeier deserved recognition as a hero too. He intercepted one of the Trojans\u2019 passes by Rob Hertel and returned 38 yards into Southern Cal territory, then twice he helped the Irish put points on the board. After Notre Dame\u2019s second touchdown, Buergmeier, holding for placekicker Dave Reeve, got a bad pass from center but picked up the ball and completed a 2-point conversion pass to Tom Domin. Then Burgmeier was holding for a field goal of 50 years by Reeve and turned it into a fake on which he ran 20 yards to set up a MacAfee touchdown pass. Notre Dame turned over the ball four times on fumbles and once on an interception, and one of the Trojan scores was the result of one of the fumbles. Perry Eurick lost the ball on the Irish 5 and Trojans\u2019 tackle Mario Celotto caught the ball in the air and went in unmolested for the touchdown. \n\n> The entire Notre Dame defense played a spectacular contest, controlling the Trojans expertly until the Irish had a 28-point lead. Hertel completed five of his first seven passes, but then threw 11 before his next completion. He wound up with two interceptions and the Trojans lost the ball twice on fumbles. It was Notre Dame\u2019s fifth victory against one loss and their first victory in four years over the Trojans. It was also the first time the Irish wore green jerseys since a game against Syracuse in Yankee Stadium on Thanksgiving 1963, a game delayed by the assassination the previous Friday of President John F. Kennedy.",

Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., concerning the right of publicity. Specifically, the court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution \u201cdo not immunize the news media from civil liability when they broadcast a performer&#39;s entire act without his consent.\u201d Although the case in question concerned a circus performer launched from a cannonball, the ruling would soon have huge ramifications pertaining to the sports video-game industry. The 1977 decision did not draw a precise line to define where First Amendment rights ended and a \u201cright of publicity\u201d began \u2013 and 15 years later, a fledgling company named Electronic Arts Inc. would take advantage of the ruling to release Bill Walsh College Football on the Super NES. Electronic Arts (later EA Games) would soon become embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA over the extent of \u201cright of publicity\u201d. At issue were television broadcasts of the games in which the athletes had played, and video games using near-lifelike \u201cavatars\u201d of the collegians, with their feats open to manipulation by the players. The NCAA had long held that athletes\u2019 status as amateurs precluded them from negotiating their appearance in the media and on video-games; this would soon change as the profitability of the sport skyrocketed. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://newsok.com/exploring-the-history-of-college-football-media-rights/article/3875459\">Formation of the CFA</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140313170153/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124683/index.htm\">SHOWDOWN: CFA faces NCAA in Federal Court</a></p>\n\n<p>Over the course of the 1977 season, fewer than 1 in 5 varsity football teams made enough revenue to cover operating expenses. But to the outside observer, the sport couldn\u2019t be richer. Following their victory in the 1978 Cotton Bowl, Notre Dame received a $1 million payout \u2013 becoming the first school ever to collect $1 million for a single game. The majority of this money was immediately allocated towards the completion of a multi-million dollar sports and convocation center, as well as the installation of synthetic turf on its football fields. NCAA revenues sat at $6.6 million during the year, and the continuing influx of money led to an increasing conflict over football revenue allocations between the powerful football conferences and the weaker Division I teams. The formation of the College Football Association (CFA) in 1977 represented the zenith of the first stage of this conflict. An alliance of 64 major college football programs (excluding the PAC-10 and Big Ten), the CFA\u2019s goal was to sell television rights independently of the NCAA \u2013 under NCAA rules at the time, any team that did not appear on an NCAA-approved telecast would face suspension/expulsion from the organization. Four years after its creation, the CFA would accomplish this with a massive four-year, $180 million deal with NBC. And in three years further, this would lead to a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the NCAA and set in motion the wheels of conference realignment. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1978/02/19/page/1/article/a-teens-rutal-run-to-death/index.html\">Bob Vorhies\u2019 Brutal Run to Death</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&amp;dat=19780101&amp;id=RYwfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J9MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1287,89142&amp;hl=en\">Looking Back: Was Bob Vorhies Killed by Discipline?</a></p>\n\n<p>When Jerome Vorhies opened his mail that fateful day, he found an incomplete transcript for his son Bob\u2019s first college semester. At the bottom was this notation: </p>\n\n<p><strong>RESIGNED EFFECTIVE 11-21-77 \u2013 Bob Vorhies died on Nov. 21, 1977</strong> </p>\n\n<p>A stunned Vorhies was subsequently informed that his son, freshman FB Bob Vorhies, had died shortly after being ordered to undergo a severe workout drill by Virginia Tech assistant coach Marvin Baker, as punishment for the discovery of a bottle of beer in Vorhies\u2019 room the previous day. The drill had reportedly included the following exercises:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cTen 50-yard sprints followed by ten 100-yard sprints, with both the sprint and return to the starting line to be completed in 30 seconds. Fifty push-ups. Fifty sit-ups. Two-hundred yard bear crawls, four more 100-yard runs, and an undetermined number of laps around the field.\u201d \u2013 William Taaffe, <em>Washington Star</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>During the drills, Baker was alone with Vorhies, the rest of the team having returned to the dormitories. Following the punishment, an exhausted Vorhies returned to the dormitories, too tired to remove the athletic tape from his ankles. He stumbled into bed, went to sleep\u2026 and never woke up. A subsequent report by the medical examiner\u2019s office concluded that Vorhies had died from a cardiac arrhythmia, with no determined underlying cause.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>*The thing I can\u2019t shake from my mind is the irony of it all. Here was this incredibly disciplined kid who worked his backside off getting killed by discipline itself. If you give me five of the best athletes in the country and let me run them the way they ran him, I\u2019d kill four of them, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d \u2013 Track coach Bob Radecke</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vorheis\u2019 death prompted a $14 million lawsuit by the freshman\u2019s grief-stricken parents against a \u201cstubborn and recalcitrant\u201d administration at Virginia Tech. Bowing to heavy media pressure, the VT Athletic Association fired head coach Jimmy Sharpe that year but maintained that the drills were not the cause of the death. In 1981, after a grand jury cleared the university of any criminal wrongdoing, Tech reached a settlement with the Vorhies\u2019 family. Part of the settlement was a written promise that athletes at Virginia Tech would never be ordered to undergo punishment drills as severe as those administered to Bob Vorhies again.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/21/sports/va-tech-to-curb-disciplinary-drills.html\">Four years after tragedy, Virginia Tech to curb disciplinary drills</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Rule Changes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Offensive linemen are now allowed to block downfield when receiver catches the ball behind the neutral zone.</strong> This allows linemen to charge ahead of a screen pass to set up blocks.

Roster</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Following bowl season, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were named national champions by the <em>Associated Press</em>, <em>United Press International</em> and the <em>National Football Foundation</em>. The Irish were also awarded the <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/E2bjKm7.jpg\">Grantland Rice Trophy</a> by the <em>Football Writers\u2019 Association of America.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Notre Dame Voted National Champions</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS \u2013 Less than three months after critics were clamoring for his scalp and &quot;Dump Devine&quot; bumper stickers were flourishing in South Bend, Ind., Notre Dame coach Dan Devine is having the last laugh and basking in the glow of college football&#39;s national championship. The Fighting Irish, whose overall winning percentage of .774 entering the 1977 campaign was the best in history, added another chapter to the Notre Dame legend Monday when they were voted national champions by the 64 voters in the nationwide Associated Press poll. In a race among five teams with identical 11-1 records, Notre Dame&#39;s 38-10 Cotton Bowl rout of previously No. 1- rated Texas enabled the Irish to win out over Alabama, Arkansas, Texas and Perm State. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s a lot of personal satisfaction in a job well done and maybe this is hard to understand but I&#39;m happier for the team than for myself,&quot; Devine said when he was informed that Notre Dame had won the AP National Championship Trophy. &quot;I have a combined feeling of being humble and thankful. I usually try to hold my emotions in, but I&#39;m kind of quivering all over right now. I&#39;m just so thankful that my staff and my players are the kind of people they are.&quot; Notre Dame, which finished the regular season in fifth place, received 371.3 first-place votes \u2014 one voter split his ballot among Notre Dame, Alabama and Arkansas \u2014 and 1,180 of a possible 1,280 points. Runner-up Alabama, a convincing 35-6 winner over Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, climbed from third place to second with 191.3 first-place ballots and 1,132 points. Texas, the only team in the country to make it through the regular season undefeated, dropped to fourth place with the remaining two first-place votes and 797 points.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Coaches Award Notre Dame National Title</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>NEW YORK (UPI) - When Notre Dame was upset by Mississippi in its second game of the season, Dan Devine faced the biggest challenge of his coaching career. The Fighting Irish could not afford to drop another game and they needed for a couple of strong teams to do just that if they hoped to capture the national championship everyone picked them to win. But that\u2019s exactly the way it worked out in the improbable finish to the college football season. Notre Dame, the preseason favorite to win the national championship, fulfilled the prediction Tuesday when the United Press International Board of Coaches named the Fighting Irish the nation\u2019s No. 1 team in the final ratings. The Irish, who embarrassed previously undefeated Texas 38-10 in the Cotton Bowl Monday, received 23 first-place votes and 365 points from the 39 members of the coaches\u2019 board who participated in the voting.</p>\n\n<p>Alabama, which routed Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, was a close second, only 11 points behind Notre Dame. Alabama received 13 first place votes and 354 points and Arkansas finished third with two first place mentions and 310 points. \u201cAfter the loss to Mississippi. I felt it was a real challenge,\u201d said Devine, whose future at Notre Dame seemed in jeopardy prior to the Cotton Bowl victory. \u201cIt was a challenge to myself and our staff and our players. Along the way you\u2019re going to face challenges no matter what job you\u2019re in. If you stay in coaching long enough you\u2019re going to have bad starts and bad moments. It just depends on how you react to those bad things.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Statistical Leaders</strong></p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Team</th>\n<th>Average</th>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Team</th>\n<th>Average</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Rushing Offense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/oklahoma\"></a>Oklahoma</td>\n<td>328.9 ypg</td>\n<td>Rushing Defense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/jacksonstate\"></a> Jackson State</td>\n<td>67.8 ypg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passing Offense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/byu\"></a> Brigham Young</td>\n<td>341.6 ypg</td>\n<td>Passing Defense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/tennesseestate\"></a> Tennessee State</td>\n<td>67.9 ypg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Offense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/colgate\"></a> Colgate</td>\n<td>486.1 ypg</td>\n<td>Total Defense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/jacksonstate\"></a> Jackson State</td>\n<td>207.0 ypg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scoring Offense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/gramblingstate\"></a> Grambling</td>\n<td>42.0 ppg</td>\n<td>Scoring Defense</td>\n<td><a href=\"#f/northcarolina\"></a> North Carolina</td>\n<td>7.4 ppg</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Notable Games</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>September 17th</strong>: <a href=\"#f/nebraska\"></a> Nebraska def. <a href=\"#f/alabama\"></a> #4 Alabama, <strong>31-24</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From <em>The Lincoln Star</em>: <strong>SON OF A BUCK! HUSKERS DAZZLE CRIMSON TIDE</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>LINCOLN \u2013 If Nebraska&#39;s Tom Osborne had a conservative image before, he erased that label with a series of bold coaching decisions on the way to a 31-24 victory over Alabama in Memorial Stadium Saturday afternoon. The Cornhusker coach dazzled a sellout crowd of 75,899 by ordering three trick plays during a single touchdown drive \u2013 an I-back pass, another on which half the NU team seemed to handle the ball, and a fake field goal for the score. Later, facing a fourth-and-short yardage decision near the &#39;Bama goal line with the score tied, Osborne spurned a cinch field goal. Hick Berns responded by diving over a mass of bodies in the line to produce the final margin of victory. &quot;You have your heart in your throat when you call a play like that,&quot; the Husker coach admitted. &quot;But there was still a lot of time left in the game, and I wasn&#39;t sure a field goal would produce enough points to hold up. A touchdown would force them to score to beat us.\u201d The strategy paid off. Fabled &#39;Bama coach Bear Bryant&#39;s Crimson Tide was forced into throwing long passes (something wishbone teams don&#39;t like to do) and Husker cornerback Jim Pillen picked off two of those aerials to preserve the victory.</p>\n\n<p>Nebraska cornerback Ted Harvey set the tempo by picking off \u2018Bama quarterback Jeff Rutledge&#39;s toss on Alabama&#39;s first play of the game. This enabled Nebraska to move within range for a 29-yard field goal by Billy Todd to give the Huskers a quick 3-0 lead. Alabama came right back to take a 7-3 lead, marching 91 yards in 10 plays. The touchdown was set up by a 33-yard gainer after Rutledge handed off to running back Tony Nathan, who then lateraled the ball back to the Bama quarterback. He then passed to all-American split end Ozzie Newsome. Worried Nebraska fans were immediately set straight by a Husker offense that started popping clever plays for huge hunks of yardage to regain the lead with a 80-yard march. Husker frontman Tom Sorley&#39;s 30-yard pass to Curtis Craig was one of the big plays in the Husker drive and was set up by a dazzling maneuver in which the ball switched hands three times before Sorley wound up throwing 11 yards to tight end Ken Spaeth. When the Huskers appeared to be bogged down with three yards to go on fourth down at the Alabama seven, Osborne sent in Todd again. Backup quarterback Randy Garcia lined up as the holder, but took the snap and pitched to Berns at the goal line for a surprise touchdown. Alabama, which had rolled along on Rutledge&#39;s passes, wheeled 73 yards in 12 plays to push in front again, 14-10. The second march by the visitors was a blend of running and passing \u2014 a 12-yard run by Major Ogilvie, 30 yards in four trips by Johnny Davis and two completions by Rutledge good for 25 yards being the chief ingredients. Back came the Huskers, rolling 80 yards in six plays. Garcia came on for an injured Sorley and promptly connected on a pass of 53 yards, and Berns went over the top from the two. Alabama probed to the Nebraska 21 late in the second quarter before Roger Chapman made a 37-yard field goal to make it 17-17 at intermission.</p>\n\n<p>Lee Kunz picked off a Rutledge throw three minutes into the second half and returned it six yards to the Alabama 39 to set up the touchdown that gave Nebraska a 24-17 lead. Berns romped over right guard for 22 yards, then Craig wheeled 17 yards around right end for the points, bowling over a defender just outside the goal line. Alabama didn&#39;t get rolling again until late in the third quarter and finally covered 55 yards in 12 plays for a 24-24 tie. Rutledge passes to Newsome, and Neal accounted for 32 yards and Nathan finally soared over the top for the score. The Huskers responded with a drama-packed, 80-yard drive that culminated with Berns soaring over the top of the Alabama line for the final yard on fourth down for the winning points, holding the ball high in triumph. That bright moment for the Nebraska offense came with 7:12 left, plenty of time for Alabama, which ground out 430 yards to 417 for Nebraska in the game. But Pillen twice came up with big interceptions and finally reserve quarterback Kevin Jones of Alabama pitched an incomplete pass on the final play of the game from his own 37-yard line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>September 24th</strong>: <a href=\"#f/oklahoma\"></a>#3 Oklahoma def. <a href=\"#f/ohiostate\"></a>#4 Ohio State, <strong>29-28</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From <em>The Lubbock Journal</em>: <strong>LAST-SECOND FG LIFTS OU TO DRAMATIC WIN</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - If Barry Switzer were a baseball manager, he would have said that a game isn&#39;t over until the last out. But Switzer is a football coach, so he put it this way; &quot;Football games are 60 minutes, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Yes they are, and Switzer&#39;s third-ranked Sooners used up 59 minutes and 57 seconds of the allotted time before pulling out an incredible 29-28 triumph over fourth-ranked Ohio State on Uwe von Schamann&#39;s 41-yard field goal with three seconds remaining. Switzer called that decisive field goal &quot;one of the greatest plays I have ever seen in football\u201d but said it was &quot;a miracle&quot; that Oklahoma recovered an onside kickoff following Elvis Peacock\u2019s two-yard touchdown run with 1:29 to play. It was the first meeting between two of college football\u2019s traditional powers and it had plenty of everything \u2014scoring, mistakes, and excitement. Oklahoma burst to a shocking 20-0 lead early in the second quarter, fell behind 28-20 by turning the ball over six times, and then salvaged victory in the closing seconds. Ohio State&#39;s Woody Hayes, who vented his anger by hurling equipment on the sidelines in the dying minutes and then slapped an Oklahoma student manager as he left the field, was far from thrilled. &quot;I thought we had it won and then we didn&#39;t. We practice against an offside kickoff damn near every day and we worked on it three days this week. I don&#39;t think the kick went 10 yards but it doesn\u2019t have to since we touched it!\u201d said an irate Hayes afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Switzer had said his Sooners \u201clead the universe in turnovers,&quot; and all that charity gave them the astounding total of 19 turnovers in three game. But ironically, it was a fumble by OSU\u2019s second-string quarterback Greg Castignola with 6:24 remaining that swung the tide back to Oklahoma after the fourth-ranked Buckeyes had surged to a 28-20 lead by playing error-free football since early in the game. The Sooners stormed 43 yards in 13 plays for a clutch touchdown after Dave Hudgens separated Castignola from the ball and Keggie Kinlaw recovered at the Ohio State 43. The Buckeyes turned back a two-point conversion run by Peacock. But Oklahoma was successful on an onside kick which everybody knew was coming, and smartly moved into position for the winning field goal, which the West Berlin-born von Schamann booted with a 15-mile-an-hour wind at his back. </p>\n\n<p>Oklahoma had stunned the huge crowd, along with an ABC-TV audience, by taking a 17-0 lead in the opening period. The Sooners scored on a 23-yard dash by Peacock, Billy Simms&#39; 14-yard run after Ohio State fumbled at its 16, and the first of three field goals by von Schamann. Then, Oklahoma not only got away with its first fumble of the game but scored a touchdown. Quarterback Thomas Lott lost the ball, but it was inadvertently kicked about 10 yards by Ohio State defensive end Paul Ross and bounced directly into Peacock&#39;s hands at the 23. Quarterback Rod Gerald&#39;s slick scrambling and Ron Springs&#39; 30-yard touchdown run got Ohio State on the scoreboard early in the second period, and the Buckeyes were right back in the game at 20-14 just 36 seconds later when Gerald scored on a 19-yard keeper. It came on the very first play after David Adkins recovered a fumble by Peacock. Ohio State&#39;s first scoring drive covered 80 yards, but the other three were relatively short ones of 19 yards following Peacock&#39;s fumble, 48 yards -- including two crucial penalties against Oklahoma for pass interference and illegal procedure -- after a quick kick ,and 33 yards after Kelton Dansler intercepted the first pass the Sooners threw. Despite all its generosity, Oklahoma survived fumbles at its 20 and 33 in the second period, another lost fumble at its 22 on the first play of the second half, and a second interception late in the third quarter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>October 8th</strong>:<a href=\"#f/texas\"></a> #5 Texas def. <a href=\"#f/oklahoma\"></a>#2 Oklahoma, <strong>13-6</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From <em>The Odessa American</em>: <strong>FORGOTTEN QUARTERBACK LEADS \u2018HORNS TO UPSET VICTORY</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>DALLAS (AP) - Randy McEachern watched last year\u2019s Texas-Oklahoma football game from the press box where he spotted for a radio network, but he bounced off the bench Saturday to inspire the fifth-ranked Longhorns to a 13-6 upset of second-ranked Oklahoma. Third-string McEachern was such an unknown quantity that he was not even listed in Texas\u2019 media guide. But after injuries felled Texas\u2019 first two quarterbacks in the 1st quarter, McEachern displayed all the aplomb of a hardened veteran and may have earned himself a battlefield letter. \u201cSure, I was scared,\u201d said McEachern, whose timely passing set up tailback Earl Campbell\u2019s devastating runs. &quot;This was pretty nerve-wrecking. Coach Akers told me to be ready after our first quarterback went down, but I didn\u2019t think the second one would go down. I really didn\u2019t know what to think when he did. I never played in a big game like this.\u201d A tremendous goal line stand in the final four minutes sealed Texas\u2019 first victory over the Sooners since 1970. Tackle Brad Shearer and defensive back Johnnie Johnson tackled Oklahoma quarterback Thomas Lott for no gain on fourth-and-one at the Texas 5. Russell Erxleben kicked field goals of 64 and 58 yards with his shotgun place-kicking leg. </p>\n\n<p>Texas was stunned in the first period when both first-string quarterback Mark McBath and second-string signal caller Jon Aune suffered injuries. The underdog Longhorns, trailing 3-0 after Oklahoma\u2019s Uwe Von Schamann kicked a 47-yard field goal, appeared doomed with the unheralded McEachern taking the field before the sellout crowd of 72,000 in the Cotton Bowl. McEachern drove Texas into position for Erxleben\u2019s 64-yard field goal to tie the game 3-3. Then he whipped the Longhorns on an 80-yard drive sprinkled with bullseye passes and Campbell\u2019s thundering runs. Campbell scored from 24 yards out behind Steve Hall\u2019s crushing block as Texas led 10-3 at halftime. Von Schamann kicked a 33-yard field goal to make it 10-6 in the third period, but Erxleben matched it with a 58-yarder in the fourth quarter. It was Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer\u2019s first loss to a Texas team and the first time Texas had defeated the Sooners since 1970. The game marked the debut of new Texas coach Freddy Akers in the series.</p>\n\n<p>Earl Campbell, who spend most of last season sidelined with injuries, was the driving force for the Longhorns as he gouged out 124 tough yards on 23 carries against the hard-tackling Sooner defense. Texas went into the game averaging 61 points as the nation\u2019s No. 1 offensive team, but could not produce a first down until early in the second quarter with McEachern at the helm. He completed four of eight passes for 57 yards and kept the Sooners off balance with his perfectly timed pitches to Campbell running out of the Veer and I formations. Meanwhile the Longhorns defense, No. 1 against scoring in the nation, continually mauled the Sooners\u2019 Wishbone offense. After the game, Barry Switzer said: \u201cI told Akers after the game \u2018I hope they win the rest of them and the national championship\u2019. They have a great, great football team. Campbell is just unbelievable and I told him I hope he wins the Heisman Trophy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>October 8th</strong>: <a href=\"#f/alabama\"></a> #7 Alabama def. <a href=\"#f/usc\"></a>#1 Southern California, <strong>21-20</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the <em>Valley Morning Star</em>: <strong>CRIMSON TIDE SHOCKS NO. 1 USC</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Bear Bryant, looking a little worn from the tension following Alabama\u2019s dramatic 21-20 victory over top-ranked Southern California Saturday, glanced upward when asked about the contest between the two traditional college powers. \u201cI think we got a little help from upstairs,\u201d Bryant drawled. \u201cWe were lucky to get out of it. I\u2019ve never seen a team come back as strong as they did.\u201d Alabama halfback Tony Nathan ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns and the Crimson Tide withstood a furious rally by the Trojans in the final seven minutes, including stopping a two-point conversion try in the waning seconds. USC coach John Robinson said going for the 21-21 tie and kicking the extra point didn\u2019t enter his mind. \u201cI couldn\u2019t come in here and look my team in the face after going for a tie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou play to win the game. That\u2019s the only way.\u201d Bryant agreed, saying, \u201cI would have gone for the two points; you don\u2019t come into a football game for a tie, you come in for a win.\u201d Seventh-ranked Alabama had taken a 21-6 lead over Southern Cal early in the final period of the nationally-televised game, but USC quarterback Rob Hertel passed his team back in the waning moments. Hertel hit Calvin Sweeney with a 10-yard touchdown pass with 6.46 remaining, then passed to Mosi Tatupu for the two-point conversion that made it 21-14. Then, starting at his own 21- yard line, Hertel marched the Trojans to the Alabama 1-yard line, where fullback Lynn Cain swept end for the score with 39 seconds left to play. But this time, the USC two-point conversion failed as Barry Krauss intercepted Hertel\u2019s desperation pass to preserve the victory. The Trojans attempted an onside kick following their missed conversion, but Alabama\u2019s Rick Neal fell on the ball, then the Crimson Tide ran out the clock.</p>\n\n<p>Fullback Johnny Davis had given Alabama a 7-3 lead in the third quarter when he slipped through the right side of the line for a one-yard touchdown on a fourth down play. The Trojans closed the gap to a point just before the third period ended, however, when Frank Jordan kicked his second field goal of the afternoon, a 23-yarder. The Crimson Tide defense had held Southern Cal, which had a first-and-goal but was unable to punch the ball over. Nathan then built Alabama\u2019s lead to 21-6, scoring on a one-yard run early in the final quarter, then tallying again on a 13-yard scamper moments later. The third Alabama touchdown was set up when defensive tackle Curtis McGriff intercepted a blocked Southern Cal pass at the Trojans\u2019 eight-yard line The Crimson Tide had the edge offensively in the opening half, but, stopped by their own errors and a stubborn USC defense, they fell behind 3-0 before the fireworks and drama began in the second half.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>October 22nd</strong>: <a href=\"#f/notredame\"></a> #11 Notre Dame def. <a href=\"#f/usc\"></a>#5 Southern California, <strong>49-19</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the <em>San Bernardino County Sun</em>: <strong>NOTRE DAME HUMILIATES USC, 49-19</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 It took USC six weeks and a lot of hard work to get here. It took the Trojans exactly four minutes and 15 seconds to go down in flames. The only meaningful statistic in this game was 49-19. That is the score by which Notre Dame humiliated the Trojans Saturday afternoon, by their largest margin of defeat since a 51-0 loss to the Irish in 1966 at the Coliseum. You can stare at the stat sheet as long as your patience will allow, and it still won&#39;t tell you a thing. There were surprises. The Trojans ran better than most people expected (188 yards). And the Irish passed better than the Trojans. Quarterback Joe Montana completed 13 of 24 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns, both of them to tight end Ken MacAfee, who roamed the USC secondary unattended. USC&#39;s Rob Hertel completed just 12 of 29 and had two passes intercepted. One of them, by his own admission, was the turning point in the game. A lot will be made of the fact that the Irish played this game wearing kelly green jerseys, the first time they&#39;ve worn anything but navy blue at home since 1958. Supposedly that gave them an added emotional incentive in front of their 59,075 screaming fans. Nonsense. The Irish could have showed up in drag and still beaten the tar out of the Trojans. &quot;Let&#39;s get underneath those jerseys,&quot; said Dan Devine, the Notre Dame coach. &quot;There&#39;s an awful lot of heart under those jerseys and these kids have performed all year to the best of their abilities. This is my most satisfying victory ever.&quot; It had to be. Devine has been under a lot of heat here, from press and public, since he took over for Ara Parseghain in 1975.</p>\n\n<p>True, the Trojans had some bad breaks and the Irish had some luck. But the Irish made a lot of their own good fortune. USC fumbled, threw interceptions and dropped passes. So did Notre Dame. Yet the game was astonishingly uneven. Because, in the last 4:15 of the first half, the Trojans turned a 7-7 game into 22-7 for Notre Dame with two devastating turnovers. &quot;Because,&quot; said USC coach John Robinson, &quot;we got the hell kicked out of us. I hardly know where to begin. We made an unbelievable amount of mental errors, and I think that spelled our downfall. They beat us every possible way.\u201d MacAfee, with eight pass receptions for 97 yards, scored touchdowns on catches of 13 and 1-yards while Montana twice went over on a sneak from the 1-yard line. Sophomore fullback Dave Mitchell plunged 4 yards for Notre Dame&#39;s first score and defensive tackle Jay Case ran 30 yards for the other touchdown after Bob Golic blocked a punt by Southern California\u2019s Marty King. Notre Dame\u2019s last score came with 12 seconds to play on a 4-yard pass from Rusty Lisch to Kevin Hart. Irish defensive back Tom Burgmeier deserved recognition as a hero too. He intercepted one of the Trojans\u2019 passes by Rob Hertel and returned 38 yards into Southern Cal territory, then twice he helped the Irish put points on the board. After Notre Dame\u2019s second touchdown, Buergmeier, holding for placekicker Dave Reeve, got a bad pass from center but picked up the ball and completed a 2-point conversion pass to Tom Domin. Then Burgmeier was holding for a field goal of 50 years by Reeve and turned it into a fake on which he ran 20 yards to set up a MacAfee touchdown pass. Notre Dame turned over the ball four times on fumbles and once on an interception, and one of the Trojan scores was the result of one of the fumbles. Perry Eurick lost the ball on the Irish 5 and Trojans\u2019 tackle Mario Celotto caught the ball in the air and went in unmolested for the touchdown. </p>\n\n<p>The entire Notre Dame defense played a spectacular contest, controlling the Trojans expertly until the Irish had a 28-point lead. Hertel completed five of his first seven passes, but then threw 11 before his next completion. He wound up with two interceptions and the Trojans lost the ball twice on fumbles. It was Notre Dame\u2019s fifth victory against one loss and their first victory in four years over the Trojans. It was also the first time the Irish wore green jerseys since a game against Syracuse in Yankee Stadium on Thanksgiving 1963, a game delayed by the assassination the previous Friday of President John F. Kennedy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
