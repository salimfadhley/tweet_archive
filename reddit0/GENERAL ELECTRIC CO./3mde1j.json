I asked this question over at <a href=\"/r/engineeringstudents\">r/engineeringstudents</a>, but thought you guys already in the industry would have a much better answer for me. I should be interviewing with GE Appliances soon for a co-op (they are going to have an information session soon also) and I&#39;m already signed up for an interview. The problem is that they are going to probably be sold into Electrolux by the time I get in. I was told two things: I&#39;ll either get in the GE system before then but be an electrolux co-op, or won&#39;t be associated with GE at all before I even get in. I was looking forward to it for the hardware/software practice, but I wasn&#39;t planning on staying with Appliances for longer than the co-op. Now that they&#39;re being bought by an appliance company (good for the appliance division, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re happy about it), I won&#39;t have that flexibility to go to another GE division. I also heard, working for Appliances, it&#39;s pretty hard to get toanother division regardless, how true is that?</p>\n\n<p>Point is, should I just try to join ITLP (they seemed interested) to get a foot into GE despite using no Computer engineering for a summer and doing IT and skip out on GE Appliances? Or should I go for Appliances, get some actual computer engineering experience in software/hardware but have the possibility of not getting into a GE summer internship in the end? Basically I&#39;m asking, do you think the company will care for more experience in actual skills or having an &quot;in&quot; in the company? Thanks guys!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
