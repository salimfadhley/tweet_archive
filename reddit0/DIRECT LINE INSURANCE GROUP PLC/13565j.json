They offer health benefits and I am \"eligible for a Health and Welfare (H&W) fringe payment of $3.50 per hour. This payment will...be reduced by the company cost of any benefits you elect...\" (from my offer letter)\n\nMy husband has excellent insurance so I waived coverage through my company and chose to remain on his. As we are in an enrollment period, I am comparing benefits again and weighing his insurance v my own.\n\nMy company does direct deposit and it makes obtaining pay statements a little bit arduous so, frankly, I don't bother unless there is a problem. I looked at some today and noticed a line item for H&W. I haven't confirmed with them what this is for as I do have a 401k with them. But, if they have been paying me for health insurance I declined, do I have to pay it back? If so, I can't do it at once but could give them a payroll deduction but would that mean I am just screwed on paying tax for money I will have to repay in a new tax year?\n\nTL;dr My employer *might* be paying me for health insurance I declined. Do I have to pay it back and what are the tax implications?",
