I was fine with the initial changes at John Henry's like the look inside, booking bigger name bands and even using third party ticket sales but I'm not okay with them slowly firing all of the original employees one by one who have been working there for years, especially when they do it via Facebook.\n\nJohn Henry's is just a name owned by a corporation, the people who made John Henry's what it was are gone.",
