My Mother still shops there because she is addicted to clubcard points like some sort of drug.\n\nTesco is still a young company compared to Wm Morrisons Plc started in 1899, JSainsburys PLC started in 1869.   ASDA is only in their 40s but is still soo young and hip since the bum tapping \"asda price\" meme gets passed on to the point where children get put in detention for sexual harrassment (I know, feminest Teachers are in primary schools everywhere) ASDA got clobbered due to their association with Wal-Mart so they are trying to hide their Wal-Mart identity now.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by local businesses, many shop at Wholesalers such as Makro, Booker WholeSale, Costco and of course direct from the local farmers and operate under Symbol Groups such as Spar, Mace, CostCutter, NisaTodays, HappyShopper and so on.\n\nSo if you don't like Tesco, don't complain, if you think your are big enough to pick on someone your own size, then do it, compete. If you fail, then we will see you at Tesco next weekend to \"check you out\" for the next clubcard point dose.\n\nA lot of this is satire, because Tesco shitted in my little Ponies muffin supply Brohoof and Pegawing. The Tesco Horsemeat scandal made me become a out of the closet person, because Tesco knows that you have lots of things to hide. There is even a Tesco outside of the houses of freakng parliament. Tesco is part of anonymous, but they rely on their extreme safety in numbers. \n\nThank you for reading, now keep calm and shop at the shop that you feel matches your politics. Tesco decides more elections than Rupert Murdoch!",
