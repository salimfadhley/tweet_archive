The cheapest quote i have gotten is 2052 (full license) yet im certain i could get it cheaper... I am looking to get a Citroen Saxo, 3 door, as they are meant to be a good first car and cheaper insurance, yet i don&#39;t call that cheap! Direct line has put their prices for young drivers up to a minimum of 3000 and the car is only worth 850! I will be the main driver of the car, if not the only driver and as my parents have polices with companies that won&#39;t put me on as a named driver I&#39;m screwed. Im 17 year old boy and can&#39;t really afford to pay that much.... Anyone know where i can get a reasonable quote from. I expect it to be high but that much - wow Best quote came from Quinn direct</p>\n\n<p>Try :QUOTEHELP.NET</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
