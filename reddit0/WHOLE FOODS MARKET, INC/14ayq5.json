It seems like they are spending more time getting worked up about all the wrong things. Almost every time someone states their opinion on the forums or anywhere for that matter, they get banned or shunned. I'm really sad what this game has become. This is why people are just getting up, taking their money back and leaving. It's because we were lied to about WarZ. Not because it's a scam or anything, because of the lack of just pure effort being put into this game. When I (rarely) play this game now, it doesn't even feel like a zombie survival game. I don't worry about the undead, I worry about the living. Not because I fear he or she is going to kill me for my bottle of water or can of food, it's because I fear I'm going to lose all of my gear I've struggled to collect because of some guy flying around the map. \n\nWhen I think of the \"zombie apocalypse \" I think of the world deteriorating day by day, having to actually work with the ones left living in order to survive, having to conserve my ammunition and even make my own weapons. In a situation like this, I don't think that everyone in a small town in Colorado carries an military grade assault rifle, while the mail men are packing AA-12's on their deliveries and the local market has their shelf's stocked with STANAG ammo and military grade packs. If this game was to make an attempt to fix itself, there would be less military loot, a hell of a lot less, and way more civilian based weaponry, such as low caliber pistols, shot guns (not the mossberg or a KSG, like a double barrel), some hunting sniper rifles, hunting bows (Crossbow and regular bow) and a lot of melee weapons. \n\nAlso, another thing that needs to be completely wiped out of WarZ. The marketplace and the global inventory. These features in theory are very cool, but they are ridiculous. These completely destroy any shred of reality this game has. I could understand someone wanting a head start and what not, but the hats are ridiculously stupid. This game feels like TF2 at times. The marketplace and global inventory summed up are bad ideas because you could purchase gold coins in-game with REAL money, and lose them the second you spawn in. I'm surprised these items aren't time based! All in all, this game could be ten times better. I hope they put some real effort into this game instead of patrolling the forums for people who oppose their game. In case you were wondering why people are taking their money and running, I hope you have an answer now.",
