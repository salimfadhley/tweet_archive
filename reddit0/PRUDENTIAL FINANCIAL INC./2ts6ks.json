  "selftext": "I like my work in Aviation; it meets pretty much every life-goal I have (aside from the financial one). Long story short, I wanna grow up to be a Jolly Old Fart (JOF) with plenty of money, but I don't want to pin my hopes and dreams on a job and salary that I don't have.\n\nI've been very good, till now, about making a general effort to save and invest. But to reach my goals, I'm gonna need to sharpen my approach to get the most out of every scrap I can. Luckily, I've been reading around on here the last few weeks, and ya'll have inspired me to rise to the task. I need some advice, in several areas (Retirement planning, moving a pension, handling School Loans, Frugality, etc.). I appreciate anything, feel free to only bite off what you can chew.\n\n\nHere's where I stand, rounded for easier maths:\n\n**Savings:**\n$17,000 in the bank, of which $6,000 is an emergency fund, $3,000 is in primary account for regular use (also to pay off my CC if it gets out of control), $3,000 is in travel (China 2016 baby!), $3,000 is to finish up my Pilot's license (Not a career, just a hobby for when I'm the JOF), and $2,000 is spread among 5 micro-goal accounts.\n\n**Debt:**\n$12,000 total, all student loans at 4.6% interest. I finish up my Bachelor's in Management in a few months, so I don't have to touch the debts until sometime in 2016 (I believe, though I could be wrong). I paid off the higher percentage debts as I went.\n\n**Retirement:**\n$21,000 total. $1,000 is in an educational pension (from back when I still worked as a janitor at a local college). I still need to pull that out and put it somewhere else... it earns no interest or anything right now. Could I roll this into a Roth IRA? Should I wait for a market drop? Taking it straight to the bank earns a 20% penalty, or something close to that.\nThe other $20,000 is through my work. My employer matches 4%. I have $12,000 in Roth 401k, $8,000 in normal 401k. 1.5 years ago I redistributed my contributions (when we got the Roth 401k option). Currently, 25% of my salary is going to Roth 401k, and 5% goes to the normal 401k. When I shifted, I used Prudential's Goalmaker to drop into an automatically allocated \"aggressive\" portfolio recommended by Prudential. Having the Roth 401k is great for someone in my tax bracket, but my stock options are bad. I'll need help from you gurus to choose the right ones.\n\nInvestment Options (**bold** means Currently Enrolled). I apologize in advance for not using a table.\n\n*   Guaranteed Income Fund............................(No ticker): ER .4\n* **Prudential Total Return Bond A..................(PDBAX): ER .93**\n* **Loomis Sayles Strategic Income A.............(NEFZX): ER .95**\n*   Legg Mason BW Global Opportunities Bd A.....(GOBAX): ER .93\n*   Franklin Income A.......................................(FKINX): ER .62\n*   PIMCO All Asset A......................................(PASAX): ER 1.36\n* **Columbia Divident Income A.....................(LBSAX): ER 1.02**\n*   Prudential Stock Index A..............................(PSIAX): ER .6\n* **T.

This, plus a bit from my day to day account, will go max out a Roth IRA with Vanguard or Centennial Securities, mostly based on Index funds. This will be done by the end of February.\n\n**Budget failures**\n I'm addicted to Fast food, and spend ~ $75 a month, mostly too and from work. Any cheaper ideas for on-the-go foods?\n\nI need to make up for the purchase of a gym membership at the Y, which will lose me about $22.50 a month (hooray for the poor bracket!). I can't give up the membership.\n\nRent is $200/month, no utilities.\n\nTo be a bit more clear, I need advice on rolling over a partial pension, picking the best investments in my 401k, advice on frugality, and how best to mix retirement savings/school debts.\n\nStay Jolly.\nEdit: Spelling, paragraphing, n00b stuff.",
