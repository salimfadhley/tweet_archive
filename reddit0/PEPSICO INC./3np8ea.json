  "selftext": "Okay, first off I want to point out I was a kid. I was bored and looking for a way to get high to alter my mind to pass the time. I was scouring cabinets, reading ever article I could and researching a good alternative to Marijuana. \n\n\nThe only way I ever got ahold of pot or alcohol was at parties. I would hang out with the hippies in back to hit the bong and ease my way over to the keg. I hit that. And hard. There was something about weed that made me feel amazing. I loved the smell, loved the taste and the high was stunning! Made me feel alive and more humorous. \n\n\nWhile I wasn't at parties getting my drink on or toking up I was at home, laying in bed wishing I had some since I felt like crap without. No I wasn't addicted, I just loved every part about smoking it. I would go to the skate park and while riding imagine being stoned and picture pot leafs all around me.\n\n\nI would sometimes try and be friends with some tight skaters and bmxers to get a hit at their joint and make new stoner buddies.\n\n\nSo, now that I for that cleared up, let's get to my experience. So I was laying around in bed and this time I couldn't get weed off my mind! It was getting late and I was just dosing off in boredom. So I decided to pop my phone up and use the internet to find a way to get high without weed. I was desperate.\n\n\nWithin a few minutes of my searching I read about a lot of household highs, but their side effects were just a little too extreme for me. death, mind you. I read about things like bath salt and alternative to meth with a side coke trip. I pretty much gave up on my research.\n\n\n But then it hit me, I remembered a spice I had experienced with before during my munchies and internet fiasco. The same stuff you sprinkle on that eggnog at Christmas time. That's right, Nurmeg! I remembered eating 2 tablespoons of it to advance my high. I stayed baked for the hours of waiting for it to kick in. But nothing happened or altleast felt like nothing happened because I was already above the clouds. But this time I was sober. Maybe it might work this time?\n\n\nI didn't want to stay up all night hoping for a high and then end up over tired thinking that I'm high on nutmeg. So I thought why not smoke it? I looked up smoking nutmeg and was surprised to read \"Marijuana alternative\" only side effects were possible hallucinations and slight shroom trip. I thought, eh I've eaten the stuff, might as well try something new. So I crafted a bong out of a Pepsi bottle, straw and metal cap to a class bottle with a thin layer of aluminium for my filter. I took some of my parents old cigarette butts and emptied the remaining tobacco into my bowl and sprinkled some nutmeg with the mixture. Smoking it puts it in my bloodstream faster, so might as well see if anything happens. \n\n\nI lit my bowl and sucked it in. The bong almost immediately filled with smoke and a strong aroma of nutmeg quickly filled my room. I actually admired the smell. I took my first hit and dazed for a second I felt weird, my pupils shrunk and I took another hit. I was starting to feel good like weed, so I took a final hit. My bowl was black and the aroma intensified. I opened up my window and lit some insence burners and got rid of the smell.\n\n\nBut then my room smelt like flame so I don't think it helped any better.\n\n\nI sat back and waited, daising up and only after 2 minutes I was baked. I could walk, I felt focus, I felt control to a certain extent. I couldn't over think (thank god) because I'm pretty good at that. My world got a black tint I felt like I was in a dream. My visions was whirly while my head was straight, I heard every footstep I took (I'm a light walker, converse user) and I felt like I had mouse sized eyes. I was depressed and felt dark and alone. I wanted no more from that point than to be sober again. I feared it would last longer than a day, but I lucked out, because I sobered up as soon as it was daylight again! But I had sat and layed staring at the ceiling dosing off.\n\n\nAll I can say is, don't add it to your bowl and I will never want to experience that ever again.",
