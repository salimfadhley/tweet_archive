  "selftext": "I just received the CLT by Infinite.  I've been anxiously awaiting this RDA.  I just unboxed it last night and thought I'd share my thoughts on it.  I'll do a simple PRO/CON.\n\n**PROS**\n\n* It combines aspects of three of my favorite RDAs.  The cyclops air flow control from the Stillare.  The heat sinks and domed cap from the TOBH, and the dual positive post from the Plume Veil.\n* Solid construction\n* Looks great and sits flush on all my mods\n* Adjustable copper pin\n* Drip well (although it is a tab smaller than I'd like)\n* Straight through hole in the cap and the drip tip.  Let me explain this one a bit and why it is a big positive for me.  My favorite RDA is the Stillare (mine are clones).  But the only real negative for me is that in the top cap the hole for the drip tip has a little, let's call it, ledge.  So that the hole for the drip tip isn't straight through.  Similarly, the drip tip that comes with the Stillare isn't straight through it too has a little ledge.  Not only does this restrict airflow but for me it causes juice to pool both in the drip tip and under the drip tip.  Which for me means I have to swab it out with w q-tip about every 8 - 10 vapes or I get juice in my mouth.  Pretty annoying.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* I can't use 28g Kanthal to build.  Let me explain.  The negative posts are milled such that there is a slight dip below the hole for the leads of the coil.  This means that when the screw is screwed all the way down it pinches the wire and in the case of 28g snips it off.  I tried 3 different coils, then just tried with a piece of kanthal to see if I could find a happy medium between fully tightening and snipping the wire and partial tightening and not.  I could not find a way to actually tighten the wire in the negative post (either of them) without either snipping the wire or having it so loose that the coil came loose.  I ended up having to use 24g (I'm currently out of 26g) to build my first coil.  Which I didn't like b/c since I use a regulated box mod about 99% of the time I prefer 28g and builds between 1.0 - 1.3 ohms.  Once I did get a 24g coil in I really like the way the RDA performed but I just didn't like the vape (due to the 24g).  I'll try again when I get some more 26g in and see if it improves.  But for me this is a HUGE con since I generally only build with 28g anymore.\n\n**OVERALL**\n\nOverall I really think this is a great RDA especially for the price.  I'd really like to see Infinite fix the issue with the negative posts, but I still feel this was a worthwhile purchase and would most likely buy it again.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Really like the CLT but an issue with the negative post holes means I can't build with 28g which is what I prefer.\n\nAnyone else that has this RDA have any thoughts/comments?\n\nVape On!",
