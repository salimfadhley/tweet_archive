According to the action item, after July 25, we will not be able to get a paper check, and will only have the option of direct deposit or a Global Cash Card (Prepaid Mastercard). These prepaid cards can be helpful for those without a bank account, but they come with a host of fees as well: (<a href=\"https://cardholder.globalcashcard.com/c/portal/starbucks/STARBUCKS_CORPORATION_Terms_&amp;_Conditions.pdf\">https://cardholder.globalcashcard.com/c/portal/starbucks/STARBUCKS_CORPORATION_Terms_&amp;_Conditions.pdf</a>). According to the little bit of research I&#39;ve done (and I&#39;ll preface this with the fact that I am not a lawyer) but this seems a bit underhanded. According to Section 30c00(b) of the Field Operations Handbook of the Department of Labor, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The payment of wages through direct deposit into an employee&#39;s bank account is an acceptable method of payment, <em>provided employees have the option of receiving payment by cash or check directly from the employer</em>. As an alternative, the employer may make arrangements for employees to cash a check drawn against the employer&#39;s payroll deposit account, if it is at a place convenient to their employment and without charge to them.

Am I missing something or is Starbucks attempting to make some more money off of us (as I imagine there is some sort of revenue agreement with the issuer of these prepaid cards)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
