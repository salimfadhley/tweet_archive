Major Banks such as Barclays, JP Morgan, Citigroup and UBS, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Holdings Plc, Morgan Stanley and RBS Plc are being fined a total of $4.3billion for preventing traders from manipulating the prices of precious metals. In a report compiled by commodity analyst Dimitri Speck information gathered from 1993 \u2013 2012 on the daily prices of gold and silver show similar drops and increases in prices. According to him this occurrence is indicative of price manipulation. \n\nPrice manipulation is not an abnormal occurrence in the market place, oil prices, credit derivatives, interest rates and energy prices are all subject to price manipulation. In the end, despite the antitrust laws put in place to prevent this from happening, experts conclude the only way to stop price manipulation is for the executives to be thrown in jail for fraud. As it stands banks are continuing to engage in this sort of behavior and will continue to do so because the penalty for being caught is a small price to pay for complete control over some of the world\u2019s most lucrative markets. \n\nSource:\nhttp://anonhq.com/banks-sued-manipulating-precious-metal-prices/\n",
