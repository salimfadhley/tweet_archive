Shortly after buying the car used I discovered it was losing coolant!!! FML!! I proceeded to try a pressure test, which it passed and other minor checks. After some Google-fu I discovered there was an extended warranty put on the 8th gen civics with cracked engine blocks that were as a result unable to hold on to coolant. I took it to a Honda dealer with the recall number and within 10 mins they took my car and had it back to me in 2 days with a complete engine block swap woot woot no issues since!!!! The TSB number is (technical service bulletin) 10-048. and here is a link <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/03/free-engine-replacement-for-2006-2009-honda-civics/index.htm\">http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/03/free-engine-replacement-for-2006-2009-honda-civics/index.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
