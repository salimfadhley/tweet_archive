  "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm a young investor who has been working on my Roth IRA over the past 3 years. I've been lucky enough to have my parents contribute to my Roth IRA while I was still in school and has been a great learning experience for me. Being at such a young age, I feel that I have a greater tolerance for risk and that is why you can see some of my investments may be on the riskier side. I have been contemplating getting rid of some NFLX since it is such a large part of my portfolio now. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions to help me invest for the future. I have been contemplating getting out of MSFT and T because they don't have much growth potential and I feel I could put it into something else.\n\nEDIT: Welp I figure that would format better into columns. Any suggestions on how to do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n|**Investment Name** |\n**Symbol**\t|**Shares**|\n\n\nAT&T INC\tT\t20.527\n\n\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC\tATVI\t44.777\n\n  \nALTRIA GROUP INC\tMO\t39.922\n\n\nAMAZON.COM INC\tAMZN\t 9\n\n\nANTARES PHARMA INC\tATRS\t1200\n\n\nBJS RESTUARANTS INC\tBJRI\t17\n\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC DE CL B NEW\tBRK B\t22\n\n\nCISCO SYSTEMS INC\tCSCO\t19.951\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY\tGM\t33\n\n\nLAS VEGAS SANDS CORP\tLVS\t20.242\n\n\nMICROSOFT CORP\tMSFT\t19.431\n\n\nNETFLIX INC\tNFLX\t20\n\n\nNIKE INC CL B\tNKE\t20.504\n\n\nPEPSICO INC\tPEP\t8.684\n\n\nSOLTA MED INC\tSLTM\t160\n\n\nTIBCO SOFTWARE INC\tTIBX\t30\n\n\n3D SYSTEMS CORP DEL NEW\tDDD\t40\n\n\nUNITED STATES STEEL CORP NEW\tX\t100.783\n",
