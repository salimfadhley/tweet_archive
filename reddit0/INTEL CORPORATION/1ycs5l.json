I'm very excited to be here chatting with you today.  \n  \nToday, I\u2019m especially looking forward to talking with engineering students. I know how tough engineering school can really be, but it\u2019s worth it. Here at Intel, we want to help you become the best engineer you can be, and we want to make sure you graduate from your degree program. We've built this site [staywithit.org]  (http://staywithit.org) to provide resources and motivation for engineering students. We need you, and we\u2019ll do what we can to support you along the way.\n\nI'll get started at about 9am PT (Noon ET)\n\nAMA!\n\n[Verification Photo] (https://scontent-b-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1/1780673_661636950559983_424068994_n.jpg) \n\n[Proof] (https://twitter.com/Stay_With_It/status/436181608597446656)\n\nEDIT: Hi Reddit. I have to head out in about 5 minutes. Thanks for all of your questions so far.\n\nEDIT: Time to head to a meeting. Thanks so much for all of your questions. I'll try to come back later in the day and answer a few more!\n\nEDIT: I gave a [quick response] (http://instagram.com/p/km5gKFGFYt/) to the STAY WITH IT team before I had to leave.
