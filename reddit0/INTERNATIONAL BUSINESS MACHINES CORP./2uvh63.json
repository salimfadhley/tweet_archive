I see all the spend and revenue, and most importantly the ridiculous practice of target setting.\n\nI can't tell you how disgusted I am to be part of this thing. I have to talk to people to give them a target number for massive cost cuttings which was set by someone else, based on nobody can explain what, and then ask them to give me a useless report on a IBM created measurement that some asshole will paste into powerpoint presentation to explain how awesome everything is. The goal is to produce a table where more numbers are colored in green, than in red.\n\nThere are too many hard working and super intelligent people involved in this nonsense. I've seen folks fearing for their job, people working for 15+ years acting like children before their PBC. There is one country in my geo in which 2 people are doing a job for 15, and they are on their edge emotionally. \n\nAnd every week there is reorganization, more and more people mention on blogs how awesome everything is and how this reorg is much better than the last 20 that happened. And the people that comment under the blogs, look at them fucking cunts, all of them have such a punchable faces.\n\nfucking hell, I've never ever imagined what kind of non sense goes inside IBM, once a great company. My first fucking 386 PC was IBM and it had the clicking keyboard, I was once a fanboy, the fucking logo meant something. ",
