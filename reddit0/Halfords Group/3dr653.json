  "selftext": "Hi all, so recently i got my hands on a brand new Boardman Mountain Bike Comp HT 650B ( http://www.halfords.com/cycling/bikes/mountain-bikes/boardman-mountain-bike-comp-ht-650b ) i have placed the components from a Boardman Mountain Bike Sport HT 650B Limited Edition ( http://www.halfords.com/cycling/bikes/mountain-bikes/boardman-mountain-bike-sport-ht-650b-limited-edition ) frame as the frame was broken and the new frame i got at an amazing price.\n\nWhat i want to do is run a 1x11 and upgrade most of the other components especially the bottom bracket and crank set. I had originally planned on spending a lot and buying a higher performance bike but this seemed like a fun idea and maybe a little project to make my very unique bike.\n\nWhat i want to know in the \"Special Interest\" is what would be the best options, i know this is a special project of mine but now i have the frame i have no idea what to buy and what will fit, i want a 1x11 with mainly Shimano and i think i might go for some Foxy 32's  - 36's but i don't want to buy anything and have it not fit or have it not work correctly with other components, at the moment im using the old components but i want to replace and upgrade almost everything. \n\nAnyone done anything like this before and maybe help me not buy the wrongs things i know my way around bike maintenance and how to build one but this is a first step for me building my own bike basically so a little advice and help will go along way, i want to make this \"My\" bike a unique bike with color and performance.\n\nI was looking at maybe upgrading the entire group-set and am a big fan of staying within one company so Shinamo, Sram, so on. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and i hope you can provide me with some awesome advice price is a limit i mean i dont want 1000\u00a3 wheels so on, trying to keep it at a budget of full upgrade set of 600-800\u00a3 for everything and make some other changes in the future. \n\nMuch Thanks, Zade.
