Really! C&#39;mon people! Is it really too much to ask to read an entire sentence? Besides that, does anyone really think that the news of the new Tool album would jump from sporadic updates stating that they are still in the writing/arranging process to suddenly announcing a let&#39;s pat ourselves on the back CD release party at the Cha Cha Lounge? This gala event with zero news about preparations to go into the studio, recording session updates, hard to tune nano-guitars, or, at least, a spurious album title and bogus track listings? Really! Come to think of it, have Tool ever even had a public CD release party? I certainly don&#39;t remember there ever having been one, but maybe I just wasn&#39;t invited...</p>\n\n<p>In another Tool Facebook post that I wrote - this one about Danny filling in for Tim Alexander during the upcoming PRIMUS tour - those who were too lazy to read that Danny would be doing so for only a few shows reacted as if this couple of days away from Los Angeles would delay the new Tool record by several years! &quot;Oh no, if Danny sits in for a few Primus shows, does that mean that he will miss this week&#39;s Tool CD listening party at the Cha Cha Lounge!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Besides those agitated souls on the Tool Facebook page, here&#39;s an example of some of the e-mail that I receive: Under the subject of &quot;NONSENSE&quot;, one person writes: &quot; So why doesn&#39;t Tool just hang it up? Babies, vineyards, following dead entomologists?.. Any music happening?&quot; Obviously this guy doesn&#39;t read the Tool Facebook page, or he&#39;d know about the Tool CD release party... Well, my impatient friend, here&#39;s your reply: The band members are currently writing and editing new material that will hopefully eventually become tracks on a new album once it has been recorded, mixed, mastered, manufactured, leaked out on the InterNet, illegally downloaded and released. The title of this new record will be &quot;PHARAWA.&quot; Everyone knows that this is the case - including holders of the Opiate re-release golden tickets, dead elephants, and those girls who went missing in Aruba...

Responding to the whole Hoola Madness, the maverick entomologist said that he considered the entire thing nothing more than an obvious hoax, and rather than waste his time further investigating any further claims made by its alleged discoverer, he&#39;d rather stick with studying his Borneo sticks and ghost slugs (not to mention new snow scorpionflies in Alaska). As for those who thought that by releasing these things near the loft, rather than compelling the band members to pick up the pace with regards to writing new material (again, if bitten by the Hoola), what if, instead, it accelerated their other non-musical interests?

In as much as I would like to explain these sightings as projections from small aerial drones - such as modified &quot;Phantom&quot; quadcopters - that might be incorporated in future live shows, I cannot say this is being tested there.
