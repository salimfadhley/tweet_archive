I didn&#39;t argue... :)</p>\n\n<p>I visited the Tag Heuer and Omega boutiques in the mall and tried a few watches on, took a few pictures which I posted here on <a href=\"/r/watches\">/r/watches</a>.  <a href=\"/u/sudo_root\">/u/sudo_root</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/13r8eh/buying_my_first_proper_watch_what_do_you_guys/c76ggfz\">suggested the Tri Color El Primero which he said was also available in the more subtle grey</a>. I didn&#39;t like the tri colour at all, it just wasn&#39;t my style. The grey looked a lot better but I still had the &quot;It&#39;s nice but... it&#39;s not exactly a Tag&quot; attitude. Haha, little did I know! Just by chance I clicked on the black dial model (which was released in 2012) and liked it straight away. It was immediately placed on my short list. </p>\n\n<p>The decision was cemented when my GF came to stay with me (LDR) and we both visited the Zenith boutique to try it on.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, onto the watch...</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>ze\u00b7nith<br/>\n/\u02c8z\u0113niTH/</p>\n\n<p>Noun</p>\n\n<p>The highest point reached by a celestial or other object.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Zenith was Founded in 1865 in Le Locle, Switzerland and are mostly known for their famous, &quot;El Primero&quot; movement, which although first released in 1969, is still made, in house, to this day! </p>\n\n<p>The El Primero (Spanish for &#39;the first&#39;) movement was, Zenith claim, was the world&#39;s first Automatic Chronograph and was said to be more accurate than many other watches as it featured a frequency of 36,000 VpH as opposed to the standard 18,000 or 28,800 VpH most other watches offered.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to get a better feel of the difference in speed go to <a href=\"http://advanced.bestmetronome.com\">http://advanced.bestmetronome.com</a>, click &quot;clear&quot;, click &quot;metronome tick&quot; and then set the BPM to 300 for 18,000 VpH, 480 for 28,800 VpH and 600 for 36,000 VpH.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The El Primero Story</p>\n\n<p>In the 1970&#39;s, Zenith; now owned by the LVMH group, was owned by Zenith Radio Corporation from the US.

Instead of selling everything for scrap as ordered, he carefully took apart the tools, wrapped and labelled them, before hiding them away in the Zenith factory attic. He also copied the procedures to recreate the movement from scratch in his notebook. </p>\n\n<p>Several years later another Swiss company asked Zenith if they had any El Primero movements for sale. Zenith did and the resulting watch, the Ebel 1911 Chronograph, proved such a huge success that Zenith recovered all their tooling and plans from the attic and the El Primero was reborn!
