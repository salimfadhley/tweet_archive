I earned my Masters in Computer Science in the early 1970s, and I have never worked for a company that is not IBM.\n\nA few months ago, IBM eliminated my position, yet again, and I was forced to find another job within the company. Being unhappy, frustrated with work, and perhaps a bit stubborn, I decided to retire.  I have since become restless, and am actively searching for opportunities outside of IBM. IBM has become a toxic environment for me, and I cannot see myself returning.\n\nSkills wise, I have occupied over 10 plus roles at IBM, including systems engineer, software architect, development manager, project manager, relationship manager, technical solutions manager, IT auditor, technical pre-sales consultant and mainframe subject matter expert.\n\nI have not coded since the late 80s, but I remain somewhat technical with an emphasis on mainframe servers and large-scale data center capacity planning. \n\nHow do I overcome my age and the fact I have only worked at IBM my whole life?  I also have not interviewed externally since I was in my 20s adding additional bewilderment to the entire process. I would be fine with a part-time consulting or full-time role.  The retired life and the idleness of it all is driving me insane.  ",
