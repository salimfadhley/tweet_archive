The recent data from other major economies, including the US, euro-zone and Japan, have generally been good.\n\u2022\tSecond, worries about the economic fallout from the slump in Chinese equities are overdone \u2013 even in respect of the impact on China itself. Only a small and relatively wealthy portion of households are exposed to the stock market. What's more, the recent slump has simply taken the Shanghai composite index back to where it was earlier in the year. In the meantime, policy-makers have responded with additional stimulus measures and there is scope to do a lot more.\n\u2022\tThird, China's recent economic data suggest that growth remains sluggish, but they are not weak enough to justify fears of a \"hard landing\", especially with the full impact of policy stimulus yet to come through.\n\u2022\tFourth, China's growth rates have already slowed sharply, from a peak of around 14% in 2007 to roughly half that now. But the much larger size of China's economy as a result of the previous years of rapid expansion means that its contribution to global demand has been pretty stable over this period. Indeed, a shift to slower but more sustainable growth in China \u2013 particularly if it is less dependent on commodity-intensive investment and on exports \u2013 could leave the rest of the world better off.  Of course, the adjustment phase is bad news for commodity producers.\n\u2022\tWhat's more, at face value the plunge in commodity prices over the last year is consistent with a global recession as severe as that in 2008-09. (See Chart 2.) But as economic conditions and prospects are nowhere near as bad as they were then, this supports our view that the present negative sentiment in commodity markets is overdone too.\n\u2022\tIn any event, though, our fifth point is that an extended period of lower commodity prices would still be a net positive for the global economy, especially where it reflects high supply at least as much as weak demand. Worries that the latest declines in oil prices will significantly increase global deflation risks also miss the point that these declines are small compared to those in the second half of last year and whose bigger impact on inflation will still be dropping out of the annual comparison in the coming months.\n\u2022\tSixth, worries about new crises in emerging markets are exaggerated. True, local currencies have fallen sharply. However, with little risk of inflation taking off and dollar-denominated debts generally much less of a concern than before, weaker currencies may actually help to support growth in these economies.\n\n\n",
