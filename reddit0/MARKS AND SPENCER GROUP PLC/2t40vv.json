Here&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sbc7a/my_20_f_professor_30s_m_wants_to_sleep_with_me/\">original post</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>I decided to write an email telling him I declined his Facebook request and why. I literally just quoted what <a href=\"/u/kiirana\">/u/kiirana</a> wrote in a comment: &quot;Dear Professor M, I received your Facebook friend request but declined it. I&#39;m glad I received your mentorship during class last semester, but I would prefer to keep my professional and personal life separate. Thank you for understanding and I hope your semester is going well. Sincerely, Throwaway.&quot; I also added an additional sentence again thanking him I did it the night I posted on here and didn&#39;t get a response until Sunday. In it he said he would be happy to honor my request but he was &quot;surprised&quot; because he thought that an &quot;adventurous, innovative&quot; woman such as myself would &quot;be eager to discover new horizons&quot;. Um, ok. The nerves have dissipated so I just laughed, it just sounds like the smart guy&#39;s version of &quot;I don&#39;t fuck fat chicks anyway&quot; you see in some of the messages that make <a href=\"/r/creepypms\">/r/creepypms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I haven&#39;t seen him since last week, but today I did catch up with an acquaintance I hadn&#39;t gotten to speak with in person since last May, as she studied abroad last semester. Let&#39;s call her K. K is a fellow English major. Even though our department is small, I don&#39;t know my fellow majors very well because most of my time outside of class, studying, and blocking out time for my boyfriend is dedicated to my off-campus sorority. I am acquainted with a lot of them but I wouldn&#39;t call any of us friends, the closest one who comes to that is K. Anyway, while we were chatting K suddenly told me that she&#39;d heard I was M&#39;s &quot;golden girl&quot; for last semester. I was suddenly terrified someone had seen us in Starbucks or something and asked her what she meant. She said that other girls in the department she&#39;s good friends with told her that I was the one he&#39;d zeroed in on. Apparently, M always singles out a single girl from one of his classes, rarely sometimes two, and basically spends the semester trying to get into their pants. I guess because I&#39;m not friends with the other girls I didn&#39;t hear about this, though I have heard whispers in the past that I chalked up to him simply being an attractive man. I never heard anything this substantiated, which is shocking considering how fast gossip spreads in our school, but K claims that it&#39;s kept hush on purpose because a lot of the girls actually want to be his chosen chick someday. Also, apparently M is the professor referred to in several posts on our college&#39;s Facebook confessions page about some theater party where a girl took a member of the faculty as her date and made out with him in the corner all night. So this is a pattern with him. It makes me feel better regarding my guilt for potentially leading him on. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now, about reporting him. I found it the most telling that the people with experience either reporting to colleges or in academia were telling me NOT to report, or at least wait until I had my degree in hand and a job/grad school acceptance lined up. So, hinging on him leaving me alone and not approaching me unless he simply wants to exchange friendly pleasantries, I will not be reporting him. If he at all continues or escalates his behavior, I will of course report him immediately. I am also contemplating sending an anonymous note once I graduate next semester (I&#39;m graduating early) to the dean of the English department, saying that the faculty need another talk or seminar on proper relations with students. So, justice isn&#39;t exactly being served here. Who knows though, maybe someday he&#39;ll make out with the wrong student at a theater party. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I sent an email telling my professor to back off, and he said he would. His creepiness is a pattern. I&#39;ve decided not to report him unless he keeps on being creepy. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
