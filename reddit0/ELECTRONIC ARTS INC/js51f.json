There were some very ambiguous terms in that EULA which have been improved. EA have demonstrated some maturity about the complaints which is a GOOD thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>Original Post</em>:</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jrk3o/eas_origin_is_creepy_and_watches_you_sleep/\">As many of you already know</a>, EA&#39;s Origin digital distribution system will be doing such nasty invasion-of-privacy things as snooping around your hard drive and observing what you do on your computer all day (<strong>Edit:</strong> <em>Read the links above for the updated EULA - EA has since updated it thanks to all of your help writing your concerns to EA!</em>). EA Origin is required in all copies (even hard copies) of games such as Battlefield 3.</p>\n\n<p>From those of you who are aware of this and don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ve seen mentions of &quot;voting with your wallet&quot; or &quot;boycotting&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Even if our numbers are in the thousands, or even tens of thousands, a boycott will most likely be all but unnoticeable to EA (and DICE in the case of BF3). I&#39;ve committed in boycotts of highly anticipated games before, and to this day, years after, I still have not bought these games. Did it work? Not even slightly. The games sold better than ever.</p>\n\n<p>If you really want to make a difference and protest EA Origin&#39;s blatant invasion of privacy, voting with your wallet will only prove to EA that they can still take advantage of the remaining 90% of uninformed consumers who don&#39;t know the first thing of Origin&#39;s privacy issues.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the solution, then?</p>\n\n<p><em>Raise awareness of Origin&#39;s privacy violation.</em> I cannot emphasize enough how important this is. Raising awareness of this issue would be 100x more effective than a silent 1% &quot;voting with their wallets&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contact EA.</strong> Send them an email. <em>Better yet, send them a physical letter.</em> <strong>Contact gaming sites</strong>, tell them about your concerns and that you extremely disapprove of this privacy violation. With enough flow of such letters, we might be able to make a change.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Let&#39;s try not to use cookie-cutter copy&#39;n&#39;paste emails. Even a one-liner email would be great, certainly better than spamming them with the same thing over and over. It&#39;s the thought that counts anyway :)</p>\n\n<p><em>This is not a link post, because I don&#39;t want karma.
