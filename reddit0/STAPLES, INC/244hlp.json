Currently looking to build a gaming PC for my friend who is currently using a laptop for most of his games, which is why he needs a keyboard and a monitor. He plays rather modest games that aren&#39;t exactly known for being a benchmark for graphics (League of Legends, TF2, etc) but his budget was rather high, so we figured we might as well milk every dollar of it and get him a PC that can still run games with higher graphics requirement that come out in the future. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, he wanted a computer that would be able to handle daily tasks (homework, browsing the internet) elegantly and quickly. His final request was for the rig to have a black and purple scheme, and unfortunately is was extremely hard to find parts that were actually purple, but I did end up adding purple lighted case fans to the build. I plan on buying a custom decal for him to help make this rig truly his, which I suppose will add 15 bucks to the final price, and also might end up buying some cold cathode sticks.</p>\n\n<p>His budget was originally $800, but I think the $60 increase in budget was for good reason. We&#39;ll probably also see if we can pick up any good deals off <a href=\"/r/hardwareswap\">r/hardwareswap</a> before buying, so who knows?
