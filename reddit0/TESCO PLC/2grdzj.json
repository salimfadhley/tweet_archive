The customers are being rewarded with discounts targeted specifically to their shopping interests. This allows for the customers to feel like a part of the company and to feel valued, leading to their loyalty to the company. Some may argue that this is somewhat unethical as the customers are unaware that \u2018personal\u2019 data is being collected every time the card is scanned at the cash register and that it is uncertain for what else (other than market research) this data is being used for. However, it can also be argued that this \u2018personal\u2019 data is being used to benefit the customers and in return benefit the company through achieving higher market share. Either way, I think customer relationship is an important entity, and I probably would also get a Tesco Clubcard if I shopped there regularly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
