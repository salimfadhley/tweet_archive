Just explaining what happened with this particular device with stock battery. \n  \n[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/DS8zI)  \n  \nThis happened suddenly to my little sister's phone. She was awake in her bedroom, we were annoying her to start getting ready for the morning when she was suddenly crying out that her phone exploded and we turned around to see tons of smoke coming from inside her room. It was literally right beside her.  \nWe did have the fire extinguisher handy, but when the battery continued to burn through the mattress, we were forced to toss the mattress out the window.  \nFirst picture is while the phone is burning through the mattress (yes, we took a picture while tending to the emergency), other two are of the aftermath.  \nThe family is spreading this through social media as well as contacting insurance/LG/etc., but any other advice is appreciated.  \nI noticed that there have been reports of the LG G3 having overheating problems with the charging port and I've also seen bad charging cables cause hazard, but as you can see from the pictures of the melted phone, it was mainly the battery that was affected.  \nEDIT: [more pics](http://imgur.com/hnzWwa5)  \nEDIT 2: the battery was not 3rd party, and the device wasn't left under a pillow or blanket or anything, it was simply on top of the bed instead of on top of a table.  \nUPDATE: after making calls, TMobile is going to conduct the investigation and will bring their findings to LG for QA. This works nicely since we're not directly LG's customer and TMobile customer service has been great, though it may take a while to hear back on how LG is going to respond. Will follow up post when this happens. Thanks everyone.",
