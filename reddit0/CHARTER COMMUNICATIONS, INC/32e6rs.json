It wasn't the neighbors. I've checked my phone, no porn. The name of the porn \"Family Secrets\" by Digital Sins Inc. Now, in the email, it gave me a date, time, and other information. In the email was also a link, it was copyrightsettlements.com. My mom, she's the account holder for the ISP account. It gave her a Case # for the website and password. She said she'd do it tommorow, as in go trough the process. I'm 15, I watch porn, I stream it, I've never downloaded it before. What should we do? Please help, we're new to this type of problem.",
