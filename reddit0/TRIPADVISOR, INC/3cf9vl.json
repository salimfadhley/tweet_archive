I did an organized tour of the Gobi with the Golden Gobi hostel (http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293956-d782964-Reviews-Golden_Gobi-Ulaanbaatar.html) and was physically assaulted by another guest while on the tour (a detailed account of what happened can be found on my blog [here](https://kulturschocked.wordpress.com/2015/06/12/facing-unhappy-realities-or-how-i-got-blamed-for-my-own-assault/)). I'm attempting to leave them a review on TripAdvisor, but every time I do, I get an email from TripAdvisor telling me that I've left my review for the wrong business with a link to the \"right\" business...which I promptly fill out only to be told again that I reviewed the wrong business. \n\nI can't tell if this is a glitch, or if TripAdvisor/the Golden Gobi are actively keeping me from reviewing them--is that even possible? Has this happened to anyone else? Is there any way around this, or any other things I can try?\n\nThank you for your help!",
