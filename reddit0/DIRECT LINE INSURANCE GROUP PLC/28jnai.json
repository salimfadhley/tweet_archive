  "selftext": "So I just found this sub and wanted to share a story from about a week ago. I work at a call center that dispatches roadside assistance if people breakdown/need towing as well as offering minor technical advice.\n\nSo this lady calls up on X car manufacturer's line letting us know she's been in an accident. We don't do accident roadside and always direct them to their insurance so they can claim and get their assistance covered. I tell the lady this and it goes as follows:\n\n\n\nLady: Well, that's fine, whatever, it was only a little ding and I drove away anyway.\n\nMe: Did you get the other party's details? For an insurance claim?\n\nLady: No, I drove off. But it's X manufacturer's fault I crashed! The car rolled backward when it shouldn't have. \n\nMe: ... What do you mean \"rolled backward\"? Was your foot on the accelerator or the brake?\n\nLady: No I wasn't accelerating and of course not braking I just started the car and got ready to go! And you should be paying for this since it's a technical fault with the car. \n\nMe: *thinking no way is she this stupid but it can't hurt to clarify* Was the car on a hill by any chance?\n\nLady: Yes. \n\nMe: So it rolled backwards. Down the hill.\n\nLady: Yes. \n\nMe: Because your foot wasn't on the brake? \n\nLady: No, my car is an automatic it shouldn't just roll backwards. I'd understand if it was a manual but an automatic shouldn't roll backwards.\n\nMe: But if your foot wasn't on the brake then of course it would roll backwards. \n\nLady: Not for an automatic. \n\nMe: What you're describing is gravity. Cars weigh thousands of-\n\nLady: No, it's the manufacturer's fault! I shouldn't be rolling backwards on a hill!\n\nMe: But all car's weigh-\n\nLady: Let me speak to your supervisor.\n\nI went and explained everything to my supervisor who was equally dumbfounded by this lady's idiocy. He took the call at his desk and I took my next call, pretty much forgetting the lady altogether until I hear my supervisor just yell, \"BUT IT'S A CAR, FOR FUCKS SAKE.\" 5 minutes later he came over to me and explained I did the right thing and the woman was going to complain to head office but he doubted she'd get anywhere because her entire claim relied on the \"fact\" that cars can defy gravity on a hill if they're automatic.
