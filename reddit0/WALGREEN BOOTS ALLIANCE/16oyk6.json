Four Community Leader store managers joined us for the Annual Shareholders meeting on January 9. Thanks to Perry Han of Vallejo, CA, Nicole Macek of Orlando, FL, Kelli Oldham of Holland, MI and Enrique Placencia of St. Louis, MO for filling in this week!</p>\n\n<p>We had the pleasure of helping staff the Store Operations - Community Management booth at the 2013 Annual Shareholders meeting in Chicago last week.  There were over 2,000 attendees that day and Navy Pier, the site of the meeting, was bustling with activity. </p>\n\n<p>Before the meeting, we were able to meet some of the amazing team members from New York and New Jersey that were involved in Hurricane Sandy. Hearing their stories really touched us and made us realize how awesome our team members are and the dedication that we have to help people &quot;get, stay and live well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Staged at the entrance to the building was our new Up Market \u201cFresh\u201d bus, from which team members provided samples of products we offer at our Flagship and Well Experience stores such as smoothies, fresh squeezed orange juice, cappuccinos, hot coffee, and even frozen yogurt! </p>\n\n<p>As shareholders walked in and toward the main meeting hall, they had the opportunity to step into an immunization booth and receive flu shots from Chicago&#39;s finest Walgreen pharmacists.  There was a private brand booth, which showcased many of our new brands, Delish and Nice!  There was also an E-Commerce team promoting our new mobile app and an Alliance Boots booth showcasing the many new lines we will carry such as No7.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting itself was very interesting and we walked away with a great sense of pride in our company.  A year ago, we took a tough stand to protect our future and the pharmacy profession, and as a result, we are much stronger today because of it.  Our employees came together as one and worked to recapture ESI scripts; we also strategized together to build other means of revenue generation.</p>\n\n<p>While in Chicago, we also had the opportunity to see our brand new flagship store located in the Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhood. The architectural integrity that was kept while restoring an old bank into a functioning Walgreens store was breathtaking. We were in awe of the many amazing services this store has to offer from soft serve ice-cream to hand rolled sushi, but what really resonated with us was how the employees were engaging the customers. Annette the beauty advisor really loved talking about all the new lines of make-up and skincare products that her store had to offer customers. Gabriel, a service clerk, really made it a point to make everyone who walked into the store feel welcome. Anthony, the health guide, loved talking about the vitamin vault and how the locals loved that their old bank was still open.  The type of service we witnessed definitely mirrors our company strategy of delivering outstanding customer experience through more enhanced employee engagement.  This great customer experience that was being driven by store manager Lisa McMiller and her team was confirmed at the Q&amp;A portion of the shareholder meeting. A shareholder stood up and stated that he &quot;could tell that Walgreens was trying to win the war on customer service by the way we are greeting, meeting and keeping the customers, and that the winds of change are happening within the store with the great employees we have\u2026\u201d    </p>\n\n<p>As we heard this shareholder speak, we wondered: if Walgreens moved the shareholder meeting to our backyards, would our customers have the same opinions of our store and our communities?  We don\u2019t all have a flagship store nearby but that doesn\u2019t mean that our customers don\u2019t deserve flagship service. Think about your stores. Will you be offering an exceptional shopping experience in 2013? If a shareholder were to stand up in front of everyone and make a comment about your store, what would they say?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your comments.</p>\n\n<p>Perry, Nicole, Kelli and Enrique</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
