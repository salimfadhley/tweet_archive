There is no reason to doubt the quality of Keurig products. 25 cases have been reported of the machine leaking water and causing 17 minor burns to our clients. With that being said, over 6 million brewers were sold and only 25 cases were reported of the product being harmful. In no way are we making excuses for the few products that were faulty, but we would like to point out that this is an isolated event. </p>\n\n<p>We understand the severity of this issue and take full responsibility for it. As of Jan. 25, 2015 a new production assessment team will be implemented to ensure the safety of all our clients. </p>\n\n<p>I just want to know whether im relatively on the right track as this is my first memo assignment ever.\nThanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
