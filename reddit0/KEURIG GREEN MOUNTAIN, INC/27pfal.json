  "selftext": "This morning, leading specialty coffeemaker Keurig Green Mountain Inc (NASDAQ:GMCR) is declining lower by $8.06 to $114.01 a share. The stock is now testing its daily chart 20-day moving average. Today's decline in Keurig Green Mountain Inc stock is taking place on heavier than average volume, this tells us that the stock is susceptible to further intra-day declines. Day traders should watch for solid intra-day support around the $111.20 area. This is prior pivot support level from May 29, 2014. Often, prior pivot support levels will serve as solid support when retested.  \n\n\nNick Santiago\nInTheMoneyStocks",
