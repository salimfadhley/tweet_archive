  "selftext": "Bored. \n\nEdit: Prom is over. I had an exhilarating run of investigation and secret agentry. I probably disturbed and confused many hotel workers, but it was well worth it. My travels took me to life threatening areas, life *creating* events (if you know what I mean) and some pretty mysterious places. I'd highly recommend it next time you're bored in a hotel. To all those saying the \"friends\" and my gf are in the wrong here, I agree. I was trying to make the best of a bad situation, so I appreciate your words of support. I'll probably talk to her about it. Hopefully I'll return back to the hotel soon to finally discover what's behind the final door... I know at the very least it's the roof, but it could be something much, much cooler. Have an awesome day! \n\nEdit 2: you guys are awesome &amp;lt;3 thank you for your kind words. For those wondering... yes, I got laid. It was my secret agent duty. Also pics are coming soon (not of that last statement :P of the red ladder and the high frequency room).\n\nEdit 3: Finally got home and pics have arrived! \nhttps://imgur.com/a/bA6Ge \nI made a handy album with descriptions. Enjoy and let me know what you think!\n\nEdit 4: Thanks to some publicity from the bestof link, somebody who went to the same prom contacted me and said he knows employees of the hotel and can possibly find out what's in the secret room! Stay tuned everybody!!\n\nEdit 5: Agent schnebly5 reporting in...the drama continues! Thanks to /u/countingchris, whose friend's mom works at the hotel, supposedly that area of the hotel is HAUNTED and guests aren't allowed up there! I did a little research and couldn't believe what I found: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_Shoreham_Hotel#Haunting. That's right where I was snooping around on the 8th floor, and I had no idea of any of these rumors!! This just keeps getting weirder...\n\nFinal Edit: Doubt anyone is still reading this but we broke up :(",
