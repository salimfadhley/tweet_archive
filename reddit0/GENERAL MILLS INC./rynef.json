However, as spring and summer approaches, its time to lighten up! I was browsing [a neapolitan dream](http://aneapolitandream.tumblr.com/) and I came across this great [picture of a couple sprezzy dudes](http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1lv00QzK41qbfs96o1_1280.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6WLSGT7Y3ET7ADQ&Expires=1333933441&Signature=PHr%2FTEEU9LGbw%2B4nMfWD9Lc2Vo8%3D)  and I realized, \"man, I've been missing out on light denim!\" All these years of working out a formula for dark, raw denim made me overlook how great light denim could be. \n\n\nSo! I worked up a few outfits (a couple of which I wore today) that integrated light denim in a way that I though worked really well. I kept my lower half (pants, shoes) the same in an effort to remain consistent (but its also because I need to get new sneaks). Also, forgive my weird smile, then lack of smile. Haha.

I'm a man of my cardigans (especially shawl) so this is my favorite look. To do this I think that its important that all parts fit really well: the shirt under needs to be slim as well as the cardigan itself.

Perfect with a grey t under since I like letting the harrington do the talking in this one (hint of that interior pattern, anyone?). All parts of this are simple and muted and that little pattern of the jacket interior lining really gives it a nice punch. \n\nHarrington Jacket: Ben Sherman\n\nT-shirt: H&M\n\nThe Coat [FRONT](http://i.imgur.com/i78Yl.jpg), [BACK](http://i.imgur.com/4GiOq.jpg)\n\nA good one for one of those chilly and sunny San Francisco days. I had red T on underneath to give it a mild hit of color. Though you don't see it that much, when you move and the T pops out a bit, its more than enough. The light denim really compliments the really solid navy of the jacket here which is pretty nice. Good contrast is definitely the key.\n\nPeacoat: Lands End Canvas\n\nT-Shirt: H&M\n\nThe Polo [FRONT](http://i.imgur.com/PH5SV.jpg), [BACK](http://i.imgur.com/9BjzW.jpg)\n\nHaha I call this the \"sorta eurotrash\" in the most affectionate way. The aviators are persols so don't go assuming they're those weird diesel plastic aviators. This get up is so easy and works so well because of, again, that great contrast between the shirt and light denim. Fit is also key: most polos tend to be a bit looser so you want to find one that fits your frame well. This one here is by Lacoste who really specialize in polos with trim fits. I'd stay away from the run of the mill RL polos (unless they're a bit higher end RL) or Merona as their fits tend to run square. Also since this get up is so simple, I think playing with accessories is a good hit of style (bracelets, watches, necklaces, etc). \n\nPolo: Lacoste\n\nSome parting words: with light denim I think you want a stronger contrast than what you would with dark denim. Wearing a navy shirt with a pair of raw denim works but when you pair a super light shirt with super light denim...well, you could do it with the right amount of attitude but for the rest of us its a bit harder and you might end up looking like [this poor sap](http://i2.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/-1/draft_lens15145021module131615801photo_1289185999acidwash-guy.jpg). As long as one element of your look that includes light denim contains a strong contrasting color, you're basically set!\n\nSo spring/summer time, gentlemen! I can bet you that there'll be tons of dudes out there still rockin their dark denim in the heat. Stay cool, lighten up! \n\nTips, criticisms, comments, let em loose! \n\n",
