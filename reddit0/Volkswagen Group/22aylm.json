Rarely been so happy in my life. I went for a 1990 (89 built) Vw Corrado G60 with a ton of brandnew parts and tons of extras and spare parts included it even says &quot;Made in WEST Germany&quot; which I find uber cool. It&#39;s been really well kept for the most part there&#39;s just minor TLC stuff here and there.
