I&#39;ve finished the whole application, have LORs from the Dean of my college, employer, two retired Colonels in the Marine Corps and a retired Major, all that, but I still haven&#39;t taken my PFT or even had the chance to meet with the OSO. My recruiter had told me the selection boards were January, April and May but now I&#39;m hearing it was in December? That&#39;s question one, question two is, I know I fucked up by not meeting with my OSO, I work odd hours throughout the week and have a tough time scheduling anything and the OSO office is 70 miles away, but that&#39;s not an excuse for my incompetence, just a hinderence. I know this is what I want to do with my life, even if it means going the enlisted route, but if I could just get any advice on what I need to do next. I&#39;ve already sent an email to my recruiter, but if someone can clarify when the boards are (I&#39;m afraid I missed the first board, and its looking like I&#39;ll have to either apply through to PLC Juniors or enlist) and what the next course of action I should take is. Thanks all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
