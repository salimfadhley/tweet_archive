  "selftext": "Alright, my ISP is Charter Communications. I received a email pretty much stating that someone downloaded porn from my network. I live in a small town, and house hold. It wasn't the neighbors. I've checked my phone, no porn. The name of the porn \"Family Secrets\" by Digital Sins Inc. Now, in the email, it gave me a date, time, and other information. In the email was also a link, it was copyrightsettlements.com. My mom, she's the account holder for the ISP account. It gave her a Case # for the website and password. She said she'd do it tommorow, as in go trough the process. I'm 15, I watch porn, I stream it, I've never downloaded it before. What should we do? Please help, we're new to this type of problem.",
