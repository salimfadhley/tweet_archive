  "selftext": "Wrote Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) expressing my concerns and asking for his views. Here's what he wrote back:\n\n> Dear William,\nThank you for contacting me about Federal Communications Commissions' (FCC) net neutrality regulation. I appreciate knowing your thoughts on this issue.\nAs you may know, on December 21, 2010, the FCC adopted an Open Internet Order, better known as \"net neutrality,\" that imposed new federal regulations on the types of services Internet providers could sell. Verizon Communications sued the FCC arguing that the regulations were too stringent and went beyond the agency's authority.\nOn January 14, 2014, in the case Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality regulation. The Court stated that the FCC did not have the statuary authority to compel a broadband provider to follow the Open Internet Order.\n\n\n>I understand the concerns expressed by those who support net neutrality regulations; however, I also believe that such federal mandates would unduly inhibit this industry's innovation, investment in new technology, and job creation. Moreover, the Internet and online content have thrived in the United States without net neutrality regulations, which throws into question the need for more government intervention. Although there is currently no legislation before the Senate addressing net neutrality, please be assured that I will keep your thoughts on net neutrality in mind, should the Senate begin consideration of open internet legislation.\nThank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.\n\n>Sincerely, \n\n>Pat Toomey U.S. Senator, Pennsylvania\n\n\nTo me, there seems to be two perspectives on net neutrality. There's the stance we hold, that regulations should be placed on the ISP's to prevent them from tampering with an open internet. This does require oversight, and not that we definitely want more government oversight, but the ISPs are proving they cannot be trusted not to tamper with connections.\n\nThen there's another stance which seems to think the internet won't be tampered with so long as there aren't any regulations placed on the ISPs. He doesn't have a bad point, as he doesn't want more government intervention. But he's not grasping the implications of not regulating ISPs. \n\nThoughts?",
