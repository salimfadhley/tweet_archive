  "selftext": "**Semper Ubi Sub Ubi is recruiting**\n\nAre you a part of a wormhole corp? Do you feel your corp mates spend more time making ISK and not looking for pew? Are you a wormhole scout who feels unloved? Do you scan out your chain while everyone else plays LoL? We may be the corp for you. We are a corp of scouts, for scouts and for pvp. \n\nOur most valued asset is our content generators. We don\u2019t chase ISK, we chase pew. \n\n**Corp Description:** \n\nIt\u2019s my experience that a corp who says it does everyone, does actually very little. We don\u2019t do everything. We just do one thing well. We scout wormholes and specialize in wormhole pvp and content generation. That\u2019s it. \n\n**Corp Benefits:** \n\n* Team speak 3 server\n\n* Siggy wormhole mapping membership\n\n* Fleet-up.com fitting tool membership\n\n* Semi Secure divisional asset program \n\n* Freedom to erect your own pos and manage its fuel. (you will not have POS roles but that\u2019s ok, neither does anyone else)\n\n* Access to some of the best wormhole scouts and pvp content.  \n\n* 0% POCO Tax. \n\n* 0% Corp Tax.\n\n**Corp member incentive program:**\n\nOur scouts are our life blood. Their ability to flawlessly engage targets in all classes of wormhole hole space is critical to the rest of the corps ability to shoot things. Without them, we are nothing. \n\nIf you as one of our scouts finds targets and the corp destroys them. You get the loot. **ALL OF IT.** You found the target, you get paid. \n\nIf you infiltrate another wormbear, wormhole corp and spend your heard earned reputation destroying that corp from within, all the proceeds of your exploits goes to you. The corp will assist you in whatever way it can. \n\n**Corp requirements:** \n\n* The desire to participate in no fucks given pvp.\n\n* The ability to scan and warp cloaked. \n\n* All bait must be bit.\n\n* Fight outnumbered\n\n* Willing to sacrifice your ships (within reason) to bring content to other pvpers we may encounter  in our chains. \n\n* The ability to be polite in victory and defeat. Wormhole space is a small community and our corp has the respect of others. Running your mouth in local chat isn\u2019t tolerated. Keep that shit in Null sec.\n\n* Keep your word when and if you give it. We honor all ransoms. \n\n* Must be on coms at all times when your chars are in the chain. \n\n* We don't infiltrate or remove corps who regularly pvp. Its counter productive to the health of a violent wormhole space. \n\n**How you get in:** \n\nStep 1. \n\nYou need to earn the respect of your future corp mates and have some level of investment. So we devised \u201cThe Cloudhunter Challenge\u201d.  It\u2019s simple in concept and easy in execution. \n\n**Come kill us or die trying.** \n\nNo rules. No ship restrictions. You can bribe your way into our chain, follow our members from a trade hub, use locator agents to track us down whatever it takes to get your pvp ship in here and murder us. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even an issue for anyone with any level of modivation or experience. If you are missing those, we don\u2019t want you anyway. \n\nStep 2. \n\nExtensive FULL ACCOUNT API review. Remember, we participate in corp infiltrations, it\u2019s part of EVE and part of the world or wormhole space. To put it plainly, we like to be the one doing the f&%king, not the one getting f*&kted. \n\nStep 3. \n\nReceive a majority corp vote over voice coms. \n\n\nRead more of our exploits http://www.invadingyourhole.blogspot.com/  -- \n\n\nhttp://underwear.eve-kill.net/?a=corp_detail&crp_id=257983 \u2013 We fight even when winning isn\u2019t guaranteed, and we have fun doing it. \n",
