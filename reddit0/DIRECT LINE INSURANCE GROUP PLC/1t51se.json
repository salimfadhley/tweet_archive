  "selftext": "Hey Guys,\n\nI was hoping maybe some of you might be able to give me some advice. I have an ~$500k commercial book. It is compromised mostly of habitations, offices (medical, tech, etc), and stores. In addition I have a bunch of commercial auto, workers comp, and contractors.\n\nHere is my current dilemma. My only direct commercial appointment (other than commercial auto) is with Travelers  [Other's are either co-brokered or through Surplus]. However, over the last couple of years their appetite has been getting stricter and their prices have been getting significantly larger.\n\nI'm considering dropping Travelers, and picking up 2-3 carriers to serve my current commercial book. With a better appetite and more competitive pricing I should be able to increase the book much more easily as well.  \n\nAs such, I'm looking for advice on some good carriers to pick up to serve this book. I understand most will want a commitment which is why I'm limiting this to 2-3(max) carriers to split up the current $500k book.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in carriers is a pretty broad appetite, competitive pricing, and a good system for quoting/issuing.\n\nAny recommendations for me? (I'm in MA)\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\n**TL;DR: What are some good commercial carriers that do business in MA that have good pricing on habitational and office/store risks? Contractors and workers comp are a plus. Thank you!**",
