During my many travels through the internet, one theme seems to prevail over all; a general dislike, or even hate for Starbucks.

In this sense yes, I agree with the general mass. No bueno. </p>\n\n<p>Other than that, as a Starbucks employee once you get past the everyday douchefuckery that involves dealing with the general public and their general public needs, it&#39;s actually a decent place to work; definitely my least stressful job ever. Great benefits, equal opportunity hiring....generally speaking, Starbucks seems to do a decent job of trying to have a sense of community, at least in the area I work. The baristas I work with are all amazing; as a team we do our best to inform people about our coffee and as a whole I&#39;d like to think we enjoy our jobs to some degree. I know there&#39;s a generalization about baristas being pretentious, but I thoroughly enjoy answering questions about drinks and coffee, and dont mind taking the time to help people.</p>\n\n<p>It just seems to me that alot of the hate I hear coming from people is hivemind. Yeah, the people who come into Starbucks are generalized as being hipster douchefags, but how does this reflect on the company itself? I dont expect everyone to love our coffee, there are only a couple of blends I enjoy myself and I can get down with Caribou Coffee and Dunken Donuts as well as the Mom and Pops in the area.</p>\n\n<p>I dont know, Im just baffled guys. I&#39;m not ashamed to say I love Starbucks, not only because they give me money but because I feel that as a company, they&#39;re pretty decent.
