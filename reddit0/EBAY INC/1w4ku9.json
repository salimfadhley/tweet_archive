No SPAM.** \n\n* You will be banned if you have a history of posting nonsense or SPAM. This includes self-promotion or solicitation of any personally owned blog, VBlog or similar social media venue. \n* Posts from newly created accounts will be removed automatically.

We still request that you message the mods yourself but if you wish to remain anonymous, we understand.\n\nKeep in mind that we can't be on reddit at all times so some reports may go unnoticed for a period of time (mostly overnight). Rest assured that you will not be ignored.\n\nThis subreddit has been relatively maintenance free but as the population grows, more and more violations are being reported. The moderators here appreciate your help whenever a post gets flagged for removal. \n\n***\n\n###This is a discussion based subreddit and efforts to keep it clean include the automatic removal of certain domains. \n\n###These rules are not terribly strict and are pretty standard across reddit. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.\n\n^(Comments have been disabled on this thread)\n",
