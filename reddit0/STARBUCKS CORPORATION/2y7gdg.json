A customer wants a short latte in a venti cup topped all the way up with steamed milk? Just.. say.. yes. The reason we had this meeting was because my DM was tired of customer complaints over the littlest things because WE&#39;RE following a standard. Sure, I get it we&#39;re making everyone happier, but what the fuck are the point of having policies in place if we&#39;re not going to follow a bunch of them? I&#39;m a barista trainer, how do I go about teaching what is wrong and what is right when I do not even know myself.
