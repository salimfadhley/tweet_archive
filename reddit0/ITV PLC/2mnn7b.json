As a young-ish person I was surprised to see how much more competition and variety there was in the earlier years of the network, whereas nowadays ITV plc holds almost all the franchises and seems to be increasingly strengthening its grip and homogenising its output.\n\nDoes anybody have any insight as to why this has been allowed to happen? Have successive governments viewed competition for franchises as undesirable? Is ITV plc ever likely to face competition for franchises it currently owns?",
