  "selftext": "Alright guys, I don't know if this is the place to post this, and I realize that you guys are not lawyers (well, some of you may be, but I get that this isn't exactly legitimate legal advice through the typical channels). I am just looking to avoid paying for legal counsel as well as gain insight from people who may have been in the same situation as I am currently in.\n\nI received my first DMCA notice (well, first five, for allegedly torrenting a music album containing five tracks, one notice for each track). This notice was forwarded to me by my ISP (Charter) at the behest of RightsCorp. It demands that I pay $20 per alleged infraction of the DMCA, a total of $100. If I do not do so, RightsCorp claims that they will pursue legal action to the tune of up to $200,000.\n\nI understand that using a mask for my IP is the smart way to torrent, so I do not need to hear that; I am not looking to figure out how to safely torrent for the future, but to learn what I should do now about the past.\n\n/r/piracy, what do I do?\n\nHere is a copy of the email with sensitive personal information redacted:\n\n\nDear Charter Internet Customer:  \n\nCharter Communications (\"Charter\") has been notified by a copyright owner, or its authorized agent, that your Internet account may have been involved in the exchange of unauthorized copies of copyrighted material (e.g., music, movies, or software).  We are attaching a copy of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice that Charter received from the copyright holder which includes the specific allegation.\n\nUnder the DMCA, copyright owners have the right to notify Charter\u201as register agent if they believe that a Charter customer has infringed on their work(s).  When Charter receives a complaint notice from a copyright owner, Charter will notify the identifiable customer of the alleged infringement by providing them a copy of the submitted DMCA notice.  As required by law, Charter may determine that the customer is a repeat copyright infringer and reserves the right to suspend or terminate the accounts of repeat copyright infringers.\n\nIt is possible that this activity has occurred without your permission or knowledge by an unauthorized user, a minor who may not fully understand the copyright laws, or even as a result of a computer virus.  However, as the named subscriber on the account, you may be held responsible for any misuse of your account.  Please be aware that using Charter\u201as service to engage in any form of copyright infringement is expressly prohibited by Charter's Acceptable Use Policy and that repeat copyright infringement, or violations of any other Charter policy, may result in the suspension or termination of your service.  You may view Charter's rules and policies, including Charter\u201as Acceptable Use Policy, at http://www.charter.com/aup . \n\nWe ask that you take immediate action to stop the exchange of any infringing material.
