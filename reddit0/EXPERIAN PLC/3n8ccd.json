  "selftext": "A data breach at credit-reporting agency Experian PLC compromised the personal information of millions of T-Mobile US Inc. customers, the latest major leak of confidential data to hit corporate America.\n\nThe breach, disclosed by the companies Thursday, covered about 15 million people. It included information on T-Mobile subscribers, former customers as well as consumers that applied for service or device financing at the wireless carrier in roughly the last two years.\n\nThe exposed data included names, addresses and birth dates as well as encrypted Social Security numbers, driver's license or passport numbers. The companies said credit card or banking information wasn't compromised.\n\nT-Mobile said the breach was discovered on Sept. 15, and it was notified about a week later. In a public letter, T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said the encryption of the downloaded information may have been compromised.\n\n\"We will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian,\" he said. Meanwhile, any T-Mobile customer or applicant can get two years of free credit monitoring services from Experian itself. T-Mobile said the data was stored by Experian and was required by law to be held for a minimum of 25 months.\n\nIn a statement, Experian said the incident \"included access\" to a computer server with T-Mobile customer data and that \"no other clients' data was accessed.\" The company said its consumer-credit-database, which holds records on tens of millions of Americans, wasn't affected. An Experian spokesman said no other servers were affected by the incident.",
