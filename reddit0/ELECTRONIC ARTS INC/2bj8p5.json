  "selftext": "**Hello /r/Battlefield_4,** This is going to be a long post. So either get comfortable or read the TL:DR version at the bottom of the page.\n\nIf you guys remember, I posted 2 months ago my recreation of Siege of Shanghai in Left 4 Dead 2. Today I have some good and bad news...\n\n**Previous Update:**\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/24j5b4/left_4_dead_2_siege_of_shanghai_update_4/\n\n**Todays News:**\nFirstly, I will start with the good news:\n\n**Hattiwatti** and **Elementofprgress** both helped me get a HUGE amount of assets I needed for the production of levels. (This being all the textures. I cannot thank both of you enough!)\n\n**Example Textures:**\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/c54789e52e7637d00312520334b87e27.png (SOSH Exterior glass on Skyscraper)\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/d7e41663a269e7a58a7044b76b5b7a8e.png (Tower Concrete after Leveloution)\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/2534f699e088d520d0fdb7fdd7e5a7df.png (Ceiling Tiles inside the tower)\n\n**Bad News:**\nThis is where it becomes painful to talk about.\n\nIf any of you remember back in February, \"ASK DICE - Linnea Harrison on Level Design\" was posted on Battlelog and BattleBlog. One of the questions was aimed at getting a Job at Dice and Level Design in general. \n\n*Q: Say I wanted to get a job at DICE as a level designer, what sort of requirements would I need?*\n\n*A: (Part of it) \"Try doing a map remake on one of your favorite Battlefield maps \u2013 how would you change the layout?\"*\n\nAs far as I know. I am the only one recreating a map to such a degree of accuracy in another game engine.\n\nSo I contacted EA 4 months ago, They responded within 2 months with a permission request form: What I requested and why:\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/b12b5fb6bb349dc73a588f71b21c5213.png\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/b36986359811d329005fe03e13dc3c83.png\n\nI state what I want to use with reasons why.\nYesterday I finally (After another 2 month wait) received an answer from EA.\n\n*\"Thank you for your interest in Electronic Arts Inc.  EA greatly appreciates our fans; however, we are unable to authorize your broad request for use of our intellectual property.\"*\n\nPersonally, this feels a little like being *back stabbed* by EA. Especially after it being recommended by workers within Dice, who know what to do to get into the industry. (I know its not Dices fault.)\n\n**So what does this mean?**\n\nHonestly... I don't know.\n Due to how short the response was, it is now unclear whether I am even allowed to design the map...\n\n**Here's my Dilemma...**\n**Good:**\n- I have all the Sound and Texture assets from BF4.\n- I still have all the map files.\n- You guys from previous posts seem to enjoy the idea of it being recreated.\n- The assets would only speed up the progress of making the mod.\n- I really want to continue with the project. (For you guys and to push myself how far I can go to make a recreation.)\n\n**Bad:**\n- I could receive a \"Cease and Desist\".\n- I could be sued? (I don't know.)\n- Without the assets the production would be incredibly slow.\n\n**Unsure:**\n- Due to the lack of explanation in EA's response, I am unsure if I can continue anyway.\n- Could it be a case of Copyright issues?\n- It is non-profit so... Can I still continue with the assets?\n\n**So what next?**\n\nI am contacting community managers to see what they think.\nI will have to wait and see what will happen within the next few weeks.\n\nHopefully some difficult questions will be answered soon...\n\n**TL:DR**\nI Finally got all the Texture and Sound assets I needed.\nEA Said 'NO' with no explanation if I can even continue the map without assets.\nConfused as what to do.\n\n**Any Questions? (Feedback is appreciated)**",
