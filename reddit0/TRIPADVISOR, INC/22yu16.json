  "selftext": "**SLNX**\n\nSolanbridge Group Inc. is an interesting find and its a risky gamble, but what was found in their recent filings I think this could produce a pretty nice gain. The stock has a pretty small float and there was some big news in the filings.\n\nMarket Value                          $979,431            a/o Apr 09, 2014\n \nShares Outstanding                  2,448,576,746        a/o Dec 31, 2013\n\nFloat                                    375,234,746           a/o Dec 31, 2013\n\nAuthorized Shares                    5,000,000,000        a/o Dec 31, 2013\n\n**Chart**\n\nhttp://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SLNX/chart\n\nThe jump in price was due to filings and what was enclosed.\n\n**Disclosure statement**\n\nThis disclosure statements shows that they own a restaurant called Davids Steak and Seafood Restaurant established in 2011. That serves upscale steak and seafood. After looking up the restaurant I was pretty suprised to see what I had. It had really good reviews, 4 out of 5 stars on urban spoon and tripadvisor.  It also received 3 out 5 stars on yelp. \n\nhttp://www.urbanspoon.com/r/219/1571722/restaurant/Melbourne/Davids-Steak-and-Seafood-Melbourne-Beach\n\nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34434-d2360648-Reviews-David_s_Steak_and_Seafood-Melbourne_Beach_Florida.html\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/davids-steak-and-seafood-melbourne-beach\n\nDavid Steak and Seafood restaurant is located in Melbourne Beach, Florida*(Population=77,000)*. As you can see from the reviews the place exists. Here is their website: http://davidssteakandseafood.com/\n\nI am not sure if this qualifies as passing the wordpress test\nhttp://davidssteakandseafood.com/wp-admin/\n\nThe menu is pretty decently priced their prices aren't to uncommon in The Metropolitan Area but I can see how some parts of the country this would be over priced.\nhttp://davidssteakandseafood.com/website/menu/\n\nAfter looking at their annual report I had seen they have made a bit more money in 2013 than they had in 2012.\n\nRevenue saw and increase from 165k to 557k. They had seen a quadruple in their gross profit from 80k to 354k. They had also increased their net income by more than 30x from 2k to 64k from the previous year.\n\nhttp://www.otcmarkets.com/financialReportViewer?symbol=SLNX&id=118637\n\nThats all fine and dandy right this company seems to be growing at a solid rate and after their third year have seen a very good increase in revenue. \n\n**THE TWIST**\n\n**(Page 9 Annual Report)**\n\n*On March 29, 2014, the Company negotiated a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding(MOU) with a Nova Scotia resident, who currently holds a license to grow medicinal marijuana in the Province of Nova Scotia. The MOU mandates a 30 day due diligence period to explore the parameters of a transaction between the Company and the Nova Scotia individual\u2014with the goal of developing a business relationship and acquiring a commercial cannabis grower\u2019s license in Nova Scotia, under Canada\u2019s Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations.*\n\n*On March 29, 2014, the Company passed a Board of Directors resolution cancelling all preferred shares issued by Solanbridge Group. The Board\u2019s action was fully supported by shareholder consent (81% approval). Any and all preferred stock share certificates issued by the Company before March 29, 2014 are null and void and those shares have been returned to Solanbridge Group\u2019s Treasury. The Board, with Shareholder consent, took this action to fully terminate the Company\u2019s business relationship in South Carolina and to prepare for other business opportunities.*\n\n\n*Solanbridge is to provide the best possible risk-return value for its shareholders, by making direct investments into or outright purchases of revenue generating foreign and domestic private/public companies.*\n\n*Solanbridge over the next 12 months will look to expand its operations and acquire several new subsidiaries covering a vast business spectrum.*\n\n**CEO David M Green**\n\nCant find much on him but what the filings say how hes been in the restaurant industry for over 30 years. The interesting thing about this guy is that he has cancelled all his preferred shares and now holds 2 billion of the 2.4 billion o/s.\n\nhttp://www.otcmarkets.com/financialReportViewer?symbol=SLNX&id=118634\n\n**THOUGHTS**\nSo yeah  this is a very risky and sketchy plays with its pros and cons just like any stock.  I like the fact that they actually make money and arent a complete sham. I also like this little Marijuana venture they seem to be interested in. At the same time I think what the hell does a guy with restaurant background know about weed. In respect I think its a huge vote of confidence that he cancelled his preferred shares and purchased 2 billion of common shares.  The float is low anywhere from 350-400 million shares.  At the same time there is another 2.5 billion shares they can dilute with.  In the end I think the risk is worth it the filings state that the person in Nova Scotia Already has their license. With the right PR this could definitely see a nice bounce. \n\nBought 40,000 at .0013 on friday.\n\nDD brought to you by /r/pennystockwatch\n\n**TWITTER:SKITHEG**\n\n**Edit:**  \nIt was brought to my attention that there was an address from Texas in the OTC profile.  I have talked some investors and they have confirmed it was Director Managers house. I will still be emailing to confirm and will post the results.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mpYfpPQ.jpg\nInformation Provide By: @vbordona",
