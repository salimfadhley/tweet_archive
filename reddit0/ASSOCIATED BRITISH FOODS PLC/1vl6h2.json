Haven't posted in a while as I fell off the wagon a bit (gaining 15lbs) then started going to Slimming World in November (a weekly weight loss group in the UK), and lost 28lbs so far! \n\nBut enough of that, what I've been most excited about is that last week I went to buy some new jeans as mine were HUGE and I had to wear a belt to keep them up. I went into primark (a cheaper clothing store in the UK) and managed to fit into their jeans! I have never bought a pair of jeans there before as I've never been able to fit, and even though I fit into their largest size, I still fit in them! Plus they were \u00a310 for a pair when I'm used to paying about \u00a320-\u00a330 for a pair from a plus sized shop! \n\nIt really cheered me up and made me think all the hard work is worth it! Woohoo!",
