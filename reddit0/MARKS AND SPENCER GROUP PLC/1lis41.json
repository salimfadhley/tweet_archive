I downloaded some stuff and when I went to remove it from his recycling bin there was child porn in there. It wasn't home made from what I saw. I went into snoopy detective mode after that but didn't find anything else.\n\nThis is my best friend. What do I do? \n\nI have so much going through my head. Has he ever actually *done* anything? Or is this just a secret shame? This explains the depression, lack of a girlfriend, and lack of motivation to get one. What would he do if he knew I knew? Kill himself? kill me? avoid me forever? Would he be happy to have someone to share the burden with? Should I shun him? avoid him? be a friend for him? keep an eye on him? Go to the police? Am I an awful person to do one of those or the other?\n\nWhat is he going through? can I help him? can he get help? Should I talk to him? \n\nWhat if he gets a girlfriend? Should I tell her? Am I the guardian of his secret? or should I be a whistle blower? \n\nHas anybody had to deal with this? Will I stop thinking about this every five seconds? Can I just erase this from being actually real?\n\nHelp me please!\n\n**Tl;dr:** I [31/m] found child porn on my best friend[30/m]'s computer. I have no idea what to do now. Help me please!",
