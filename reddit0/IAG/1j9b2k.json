There are no notices that bikes cannot be chained to the posts, etc.  Came back and bike was missing, walked around for about 30 minutes and found that the bike was laying down on a pile of trash around the rear of the building.  Unfortunately it was not sleeping and there was gas everywhere.  There was no notice left on my bike ever and I'm f'ing livid.\n\nI live in Philadelphia if anyone has experience with this area.  Thanks for your help!\n\n\nEDIT:\nHere's some sad looking photos of my little guy sleeping in the rain without a blanket\nhttp://imgur.com/MRf2E9p\nhttp://imgur.com/1IAG5Vy",
