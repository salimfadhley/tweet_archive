I considered myself more of an supportive observer than a participant, but that cannot stand any longer. Gawker went too far in their endorsement of bullying \"nerds\", and in their disrespectful tone toward those who were genuinely upset by their statements. This is bigger to me than just the concerns surrounding games journalism.\n\nI saw users here trying to find a way to reach out to Gawker's advertisers, and while I saw lists of said advertisers, there was no contact information attached to these lists. Therefore, I took it upon myself to do my best research to find means of contacting these advertisers directly. I'm not going to try to organize any boycotts or mass emails at this time, as other members of the community have shown a great capability for that, but I wanted to make this information available to those who can use it best.\n\nedit1: Fixed a couple format errors, and added bolding to company names for easier reading.\n\nedit2: You can also support Lo-Ping's Pacer Charity for Bullying Prevention [here!](https://www.crowdrise.com/gamergatestompsoutbullying/)\n\nedit3: Updated contact info for Dove thanks to AbeAwesome. Will be adding other forms of contact info provided by users throughout the day as well, I'll note any big changes up here. Also, it was quite nice to wake up today and see MB has already pulled their support. Very encouraging, and I'm glad everybody is finding this useful. :)\n\nedit4: Also added CEO contact info for a few companies courtesy of Dudeinab0x. Thanks! Also adding better emails for various companies thanks to iluvthefbi and mikabast. Furthermore, [here is a pastebin of a lot of this info](http://pastebin.com/X0EvX7RG) by synthesizerToady. Useful for non-reddit sharing!\n\nedit5: For clarity, [this image here](http://i.imgur.com/cHAOB6I.png) is what I used to determine Gawker's major advertisers. If anybody has better proof of these associations, or any information about changes to this list, please let me know and I'll update this post ASAP. Thanks!\n\nedit6: Added CEO Emails for Newegg and Yahoo. Made a note to the Google e-mail following messages indicating that it was being bounced back. Also, I didn't say this before since I trust you guys, but I feel it's worth emphasizing proper politeness if you're contacting an e-mail that belongs to a CEO. It's a powerful tool, and we should use it wisely. :)\n\n**Microsoft**:\nAccording to Microsoft's [website](http://news.microsoft.com/microsoft-public-relations-contacts/), [this agency](http://www.mccannny.com/about-mccann-new-york/) is in charge of their advertising PR. The following is the e-mail listed on their website:\n(prny@mccann.com)\nAlso, their CEO's email is apparently satyan@microsoft.com\n\n**Intel**:\n[Submit a form here](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/forms/corporate-responsibility-contact-us.html)\nCEO Email: Brian.Krzanich@intel.com\n\n**Motorola**:\n[This is their general inquiry submission form](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_launch/p_country_code/US/p_reference/moto_integration.php)\n**EDIT** Thanks to honestbastarddad for [this much better contact form](https://forums.motorola.com/contact)!\n\n**State Farm**:\nDiffiult to track down a single e-mail for this sort of thing. Best I could find is [this page](https://www.statefarm.com/about-us/newsroom/media-contacts), which lists a phone number (309-766-2311) for \"Customer Service, Marketing and Advertising, Sales, and General Inquiries.\" It also includes contact info for their media representatives in all U.S. States, including e-mails, which may be more useful.\nCEO Email: Ed.Rust.atei@statefarm.com\nPR Emaill: holly.anderson.m3mj@statefarm.com\n\n**Samsung**:\nThanks to Krosen333's thread for these contacts:\n\n(d2.cohen@sea.samsung.com) - Danielle Meister Cohen\n\n(samsungpr@edelman.com) - Edelman PR Team\n\nCEO Email: o.kwon@samsung.com\n\n**IBM**:\n[They have a form to submit here](http://www.ibm.com/scripts/contact/contact/us/en)\n\n**American Express**:\nSadly, they only seem to have a phone number, and no form of e-mail contact for customer service or non-press PR. The number is 1-800-954-0559, for what it's worth.\n\n**HP**:\n[General non-support Contact Form](https://ssl.www8.hp.com/us/en/company-information/executive-team/ceo-index.html)\n\n**Google**:\nAnother large company with no e-mail for customer service, sadly. The best I could find was [this guide](http://www.wikihow.com/Contact-Google), with phone numbers for customer service based on country. Might be worthwhile, but again, I think most folks would prefer e-mails.\nCEO Email: dwoodside@google.com, although I have heard it is not working. If anybody has more experiences with this, let me know and I'll remove it.\n\n**Blackberry**:\nDifficult to find again. (mediarelations@blackberry.com) seems to be the closest fit, otherwise @BlackBerry on Twitter might be a good resource. Otherwise, all their contact info seems to be related to tech support, and mostly redirects to online manuals rather than human reps anyway.\n\n**Virgin Mobile**:\n\nA contact form can be found [here](https://www2.virginmobileusa.com/about/prepareEmailUs.do), but it's only for people who use Virgin Mobile already. The page does include a phone number for general use, however.\n\n**Sprint**:\nI'm getting a bit saddened at how hard it is to find e-mail contacts for a lot of these big companies...at any rate, [sprint only seems to offer forum-based support and a phone number to call, seen on this page](https://mysprint.sprint.com/mysprint/jsp/landingPage/contactus.jsp). Their customer service Twitter @Sprintcare might be a better option.\n\n**Acer**:\nIt seems direct customer service is on [this page](http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/service-contact), but only avaiable to Acer customers. A general phone number is 408-533-7700, and their company twitter is @Acer.\n\n**AMC**:\nPlease note that, based on the logo in the original image, this appears to be AMCTV, a separate entity from AMC Theatres. The AMCTV email address is (amccustomerservice@amcnetworks.com). Additional emails:\nAMCPressHelp@amcnetworks.com\ndigitaladsales@amctv.com\n\n**Electronic Arts**:\n(customerservice@ea.com)\n\n**Dove Men Care**:\nCan't find one for this sub-brand, but Dove themselves have a [contact form here](https://secure.dove.us/About-Dove/Contact-Us/contactusform.aspx). **EDIT**: thanks to AbeAwesome for providing [this means of contacting their parent company](http://www.unilever.com/resource/Contactus/index.aspx). And also for the info that Dove is currently supporting \"campaigns for self-esteem,\" and would probably be very concerned to hear about Gawker's advocacy of bullying.\n\n**Glaceau SmartWater**:\nCan be reached through the main Coca-Cola Company page [here](https://secure.coca-colacompany.com/ssldocs/mail/eQuery_product.shtml).\n\n**Bing**:\nI think the best bet would just be to contact Microsoft directly, via the e-mail at the top of this post, (prny@mccann.com)\n\n**Scion**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://scion.custhelp.com/app/ask).\n\n**Comcast**:\n(We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com) seems to be the most reliable to way to reach someone. From what I looked into, this may only help to get redirected to the proper channels, but at least it's a start and much better than their support pages.\n\n**HBO**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.hbo.com/index.html#/about/contact-us.html) They also have these emails:\nQuentin.Schaffer@hbo.com\nJeff.Cusson@hbo.com\n\n**LogMeIn**:\nDoesn't seem to have a direct e-mail, but there is a contact page [here](http://help.logmein.com/SelfServiceContact). Twitter is @LogMeIn, for what it's worth.\n\n**Johnnie Walker**:\n(keepwalking@johnniewalker.com)\n\n**Radio Shack**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.radioshack.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?stillHaveQuestion=yes&subdisplay=contact&display=store).\n\n**BMW**:\n(customerrelations@bmwusa.com)\n\n**EBAY**:\nHonestly...they don't seem to be contactable for this sort of thing. All of their customer service resourcers relate to sale disputes or account issues, from what I could find. If anybody can turn up anything else, that would be awesome.\n**EDIT** Thanks to MannoSlimmins for finding an email we can contact! Guillermo Debernardo, Head of Marketing for eBay Inc. gdebernardo@ebay.com.\n\n**HTC**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.htc.com/us/contact/email/).\n\n**Cisco**:\nThey have a general contact page [here](http://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/siteassets/contacts/index.html), but something more specific would be desirable. edit: found something posted by MannoSlimmins in an older thread. Their Director of Marketing is Faraz Aladin, and can be reached at faladin@cisco.com.\n\n**T-Mobile**:\nNo direct email, but a support page [here](http://www.t-mobile.com/contact-us.html) with options for reaching them by phone or live chat.\n\n**AT&T**:\n[More phone numbers, support forms, live chat, etc.](http://www.att.com/contactus/). I guess phone companies just don't like providing e-mail addresses, sadly.\n\n**Verizon**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](https://www.verizon.com/Support/Residential/contact-us/email-us.htm). Alternatively, courtesy of a post by TheCodexx;\n\nExecutive Director of Media Relations\n(robert.a.varettoni@verizon.com)\n\nManager of Media Relations\n(raymond.mcconville@verizon.com)\n\nExecutive Director of Public Policy\n(edward.s.mcfadden@verizon.com)\n\n**Nissan**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.nissanusa.com/apps/contactus).\n\n**Budweiser**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://contactus.anheuser-busch.com/contactus/ab/contact_us.asp).

Not sure which would be a better fit.\n\n**Adobe**:\nThey have a [general customer service page](http://helpx.adobe.com/contact.html).\n\n**Old Spice**:\n~~You can submit a form email [here](https://pgconsumercare.secure.force.com/ContactUs/SitesContactUsV2?sid=OldSpiceUS-English2&siteid=OldSpiceUS-English2PKB).~~ They've responded and said to instead please direct our comments to [this page](http://www.pg.com/en_UK/contact-us.shtml) or email thurston.d@pg.com.

Also, they have several PR-related emails:\najackso1@jaguarlandrover.com\njgriff76@jaguarlandrover.com\nlpalmer1@jaguarlandrover.com\n\n**The CW**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.cwtv.com/feedback/comments/), or email paul.hewitt@cwtv.com.\n\n**Hulu**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.hulu.com/help#email).\n\n**Smart USA**:\nYou can get to a form email by clicking on \"General Requests and Comments\" on [this page](http://www.smartusa.com/contact/).\n\n**BBC America**:\nYou can submit a form email [here](http://www.bbcamerica.com/contact-us/)\n\n**Sundance Channel**:\nPart of the AMC Networks, so they can also be contacted via (amccustomerservice@amcnetworks.com), or emailed at Institute@sundance.org.\n\n**Focus Features**:\nVery barebones contact options. Only thing I could find is [this page](http://www.focusfeatures.com/contact), which doesn't seem to have what we would need.\nBig thanks to Mikabast for this email: focusfeaturespress@thaweb.com\n\n**Yahoo**:\nSome limited options [here](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/contacting-yahoo-customer-care-support-sln5856.html?impressions=true), but like a lot of the bigger companies they are rather lacking. **EDIT** CEO Email: marissa.mayer@yahoo-inc.com Ms. Marissa A. Mayer.\n\n**Bonobos**:\nYou can find their [Contact a Ninja page here](http://www.bonobos.com/help), which seems to be their main outlet for customer service emails.\n\n**ABC**:\nForm email [here](http://site.abc.go.com/site/contactus.html), but they have a rather strict character limit.\nChevrolet:\nYou can submit a form email [here](https://www.chevrolet.com/contact/email-us.html).\n\n**New Egg**:\nContact form [can be found here](http://www.newegg.com/Info/PressInquires.aspx). Considering their market, they seem like a very good place to be e-mailing. Note that they are not advertising on Gawker itself, from what I can tell, but on Gawker-family sites like Kotaku. I put them here due to the relevance of their market, as I may do for other organizations over time. CEO Email: fred.chang@newegg.com Mr. Fred Chang. edit: I'm hearing that the CEO E-mail isn't working. If anybody else is having issues, let me know.",
