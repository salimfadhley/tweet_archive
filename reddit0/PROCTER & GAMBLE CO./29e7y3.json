For example, the major holdings within the fund are as follows:\n\nApple Inc ORD (AAPL), Exxon Mobil Corp ORD (XOM)\t, Microsoft Corp ORD (MSFT), Google Inc ORD (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson ORD (JNJ), General Electric Co ORD (GE), Wells Fargo & Co ORD (WFC), Chevron Corp ORD (CVX), Berkshire Hathaway Inc ORD (BRK.B), and Procter & Gamble Co ORD (PG).\n\nTo my basic intuition, when the S&P 500 swings downwards, these funds will also take a dip. What mutual fund would best help me hedge against this downside risk? thanks for your comments.\n\n-deathstardown-",
