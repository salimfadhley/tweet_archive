Since October 25th I have played BF3 every single day with buddies on teamspeak.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this morning (November 25th), I had attempted to join a server on Battlelog, but was greeted with an error message telling me I couldn&#39;t connect to EA Online. I then tried several different other servers, all giving the same error.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking it was a problem with my browser, I closed Internet Explorer out, and then reopened it again and tried to login to Battlelog, only to be greeted by the message &quot;Buy BF3 to get access to Battlelog&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I figured it was a temporary issue with EA&#39;s servers, so I walked away from my PC for a couple hours, ate, watched some tv and then came back to try and play again, only to be greeted with the same message at the login screen, &quot;Buy BF3 to get access to Battlelog&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately contacted EA&#39;s support and spoke with an advisor in a chat. This advisor informed me my account was temporarily banned for 72 hours.</p>\n\n<p>I checked my email and lone behold I had an email from EA, informing me my EA Online Account was banned for using the word &quot;Badass&quot; on the battlelog forums. The context that the word was used in, was myself calling Germany a badass country. Note, I posted this in the General/Off-Topic forum as well. </p>\n\n<p>Apparently this really angered a mod for some reason and I was banned for 72 hours. My plea&#39;s to various mods on the EA forums were met with obvious defense of EA&#39;s ridiculous policies. Yet none of them would admit that a forum ban and a game ban should be seperate.</p>\n\n<p>I am now completely unable to access Battlelog at all, to play the game that I PAID FOR.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>EDIT: Here is an exact copy of the email, for those doubting me. Also my battlelog name is &quot;UDeadNowSucka&quot; without the quotes</h2>\n\n<p>Hello ,</p>\n\n<p>Your Electronic Arts account has been suspended for 72 hours for violating the Terms of Services for Electronic Arts Online.</p>\n\n<p>Violation:Inappropriate language</p>\n\n<p>[almost as badass as germany.

I spoke to Canuck in a pm on the EAUK forums about this whole thing, in which we sent several pm&#39;s back and forth to one another. He searched through my entire battlelog post history, found one thing to latch onto, and then tried using it as a reason to defend EA&#39;s 72 hour ban. Yet he couldn&#39;t pull his head far enough out of EA&#39;s ass to realize that unbanning me from battlelog so I could play the game, but keeping me banned from the forums in battlelog was pretty reasonable. In fact, I even proposed that as a middle-ground and he wouldn&#39;t agree too it.</p>\n\n<p>Second EA Employee Interaction: Crash7800</p>\n\n<p>Crash7800 is the Battlefield Community Manager at EA. I tweeted Crash7800 about this on twitter and he never responded back. Not even a direct message or anything. Not even &quot;hey, I heard about your case, nothing I can do, sorry&quot;. I heard Crash7800 sent someone his dogtags in the mail for making a video. But he can&#39;t look into a forum ban that was unjustified? </p>\n\n<p>Third EA Employee Interaction: Zh1nt0</p>\n\n<p>Zh1nt0 is the Global Community Manager for EA/DICE. Zh1nt0 pm&#39;d me on the EAUK forums the day this happened, after seeing my forum post and asked me for my battlelog name to look into the issue. Then never got back to me.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>EDIT: Here is Crash&#39;s response:</h2>\n\n<p>Sorry that I didn&#39;t reply sooner - Holiday here :) I&#39;ve been checking in where I can, but I&#39;m sorry your issue wasn&#39;t on my radar at first.\n \u2022\nIt will take me some time to look into this issue.

You were probably banned for the reasons I&#39;ve listed above. I probably would have temporarily banned you too for spamming nonsense and acting like a troll.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT for clarity: To that end, I will be looking into this issue to determine whether this is indeed the case.
