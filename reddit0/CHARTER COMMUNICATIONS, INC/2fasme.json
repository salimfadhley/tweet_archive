  "selftext": "A few week ago, I downloaded a Johnny Cash album off the Pirate Bay which contained 40 songs. Now, I am receiving emails from Charter about illegally downloading songs forwarded from BMG via Charter to me. I have received 6 emails so far (one for each song) and they are urging me to pay $20 for each song. As a 17 year old that only has a summer job, this is really stressing me out because I could potentially be paying a $800 penalty. Where should I go from here? I've heard of scams regarding things of this such but I can't help but to ignore that these emails are coming from abuse@charter.net.\n\nIs this a legitimate case? Should I pay the $20 a song or is there any way around this. Not looking into getting a lawyer. I know I'm not the only one that has had this happen to themselves so any input would be absolutely fantastic. I should have been using a VPN.\n\nThank you very much. Below I provided the torrent link an email that Charter sent me.\n\nJohnny Cash Album Torrent:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6394953/Johnny_Cash_The_Ultimate_Best_Of_2011_Remastered_320_Kbps\n\nEmail from Charter:\nDear Charter Internet Customer:\n\nCharter Communications (\"Charter\") has been notified by a copyright owner, or its authorized agent, that your Internet account may have been involved in the exchange of unauthorized copies of copyrighted material (e.g., music, movies, or software).
