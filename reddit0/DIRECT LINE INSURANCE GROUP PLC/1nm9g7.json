During the day, there are 2 pharmacists on staff and 4-5 technicians. At night, there is 1 pharmacist and 2 technicians. Myself, and my colleague &quot;Tracy&quot;. For context, the country I live in allows us to sell extra strength advil, Gravol and codeine cough syrup without a prescription. However, the pharmacist is technically required to take your information and enter it into a file in our system so as to avoid abuse but also to check that there&#39;s no interaction with any other of your meds (people drink with Gravol and elderly patients take extra strength advil with their coumadin - big no no). MOST experienced pharmacists generally wave it off and just give the person the product (we keep all of these behind the counter). </p>\n\n<p>Now, a couple of months ago, a new pharmacist (whom we&#39;ll call Linda) started her first &quot;real&quot; job straight out of university. Seriously, she&#39;s 23 years old (the same age as me) but anyway... Needless to say, she takes her newly acquired license VERY seriously. She follows the &quot;law&quot; I mentioned above - almost to a fault, as you&#39;ll soon see. She&#39;s Lebanese (dark-ish skinned) and a very devout Christian (this is relevant later).</p>\n\n<p>On this extremely busy Monday, a 40s-ish woman whom I recognize as having been overly aggressive once before (a long time ago) comes up to the counter with a script. We&#39;ll call her Thelma because she&#39;s an ugly person who should have an ugly name (no offense to any Thelmas out there). She politely asks Tracy where she can find the Gravol. Tracy tells her that it&#39;s an over the counter product, but that Thelma&#39;s insurance will cover it so there&#39;s no tax. Tracy directs the woman to the waiting area, puts the sticker on the box and puts the basket next to the long line of other people waiting for their scripts.</p>\n\n<p>Did I mention it was busy that day? Linda was really stressed out and trying to work as fast as she could. This being her first job, she&#39;s trying to be extra careful. People are starting to get antsy but we seem to have it under control.</p>\n\n<p>Until Thelma goes over to the cash register part of the counter and not five minutes later starts whining about the wait.</p>\n\n<p>Thelma: &quot;Why am I waiting for this? You said it was an over the counter product.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Me: &quot;Ma&#39;am we have to enter it in your file. It&#39;s standard procedure.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Thelma: &quot;Okay well in that case, I won&#39;t use it as a prescription. Can I have my paper back? I&#39;ll just buy it from you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Me: &quot;I&#39;m sorry ma&#39;am but the procedure, even without a prescription, requires us to enter the product in your file to check for interactions with other medications.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Thelma: &quot;WHAT? That&#39;s insane! I don&#39;t even take any medications. Every other time I&#39;ve come in here, they&#39;ve just given it to me. What the FUCK?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Linda all of a sudden calls out from behind the counter in, admittedly, a pretty aggressive tone: &quot;Ma&#39;am PLEASE. You will have to wait like everybody else. It will take at least five more minutes.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ok guys. Seriously. This is where shit hit the fan. You should have seen the look on Thelma&#39;s face.</p>\n\n<p>Thelma: &quot;EXCUSE ME? HOW. DARE. YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE THAT YOU CAN SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT? I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THIS FROM SOME LITTLE.. SOME LITTLE PREPPY-ASS <strong>BITCH</strong>!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I was standing right there and the way in which she said that word... spit flew out of her mouth and her eyes watered. Actually.</p>\n\n<p>Linda throws down her pen and charges over to the counter, where she proceeds to scream into Thelma&#39;s face (with her finger pointed in her face): &quot;YOU WILL NOT ADDRESS ME LIKE THAT. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A WAY. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO INSULT ME, I WILL NOT PERMIT IT. LEAVE! LEAVE NOW!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>At this point, the assistant manager has shown up, as well as a store clerk (a 20 year old lanky kid. security was off that day go figure) and they are trying to calm Thelma down. </p>\n\n<p>Thelma: &quot;WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SAYING, THAT I&#39;M NOT ALLOWED TO ADDRESS YOU THIS WAY? WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS, A FUCKING MOSQUE??&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She then got escorted out of the store, ranting and raving that she&#39;ll get Linda&#39;s name and have her fired. It ended as suddenly as this post is about to.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
