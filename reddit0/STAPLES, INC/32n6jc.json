I call on my radio \"Hey (ET associate Name) are you busy?\" Reply:\"No\" \"Can you pickup that phone call? I'm with a customer\" Reply: \"(sigh)..you know you really need to learn how to multitask\" What is he doing, BSing with our IS which I don't mind but if I'm with a customer, I can't be interrupting them to answer the phone which we all know won't be \"How late are you open\" but \"I need a cable that goes from USB A to Micro-Mini-USB-HDMI female 9-pins\". He is also butting in to my conversations with customers and always seems to like to argue with customers when its clear they don't want to hear it. Its not just him its one of my AMs too, would you like me to ignore the customer that I am helping?? Again, the next person to tell me to multitask becomes bloody and broken and thrown into the dumpster outback \n(the preceding is not a threat of violence just a frustrated rant no assault will be inflicted on any employees of Staples, Inc or its contractors LOL )",
