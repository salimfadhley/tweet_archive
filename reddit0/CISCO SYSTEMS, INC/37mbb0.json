They want to update the IOS image on the switches, and I was pretty sure I saw a feature somewhere in, or read about a feature somewhere, where you can upload the IOS image to Prime and push it to all the switches. Is this true? It would be much easier to do something like that than to manually connect to each switch through tftp or some other means.\n\nAll switches are Cisco Catalyst 3560x and are currently running code version 15.0(2)SE3. I am not exactly sure what version I would want to update to yet, because I need to check the DoD FIPS compliance list and see which versions have been approved for use.\n\nCisco Prime Infrastructure show ver:\nDRENPrimeWireless/WiFiAdmin# show ver\n\nCisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 2.3\nADE-OS Build Version: 2.3.0.101-root\nADE-OS System Architecture: x86_64\n\nCopyright (c) 2005-2010 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nAll rights reserved.\nHostname: DRENPrimeWireless\n\nVersion information of installed applications\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCisco Prime Infrastructure\n********************************************************\nVersion : 2.2.0\nBuild : 2.2.0.0.158\n\nIf there is any other information I can give you all that would help you guys answer my question, please comment and I will try and get right back to you.
