This came on the back of an explosive move known to traders and investors as a blow-off top (previous 2 weeks). In addition, stocks like Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) reported earnings. Significant distribution appears to be taking hold on these names. Ultimately, while timing is not Fed Chair Janet Yellen&#39;s forte, nor was it Greenspan&#39;s, it is important to take it as an important heads up.
