  "selftext": "So, a couple days ago I dec'd a corp.\n\nI'm a one man outfit, and I like flying solo. Wardecs are a way that I can control the degree to which I get blobbed. As long as I have a fairly complete memberlist of the corps I've dec'd, I can avoid those 1v20 situations that I routinely get in null.\n\nEven as a one man corp, my decs routinely cause corps to fold and reopen under a new name. This I am used to. But last night, I saw a technique for the first time that really rustled my jimmies.\n\nI was hunting what seemed to be a clueless ratter. I scanned him down with a cloaky neutral and watched him running a pretty tame hisec anom in a cruiser. I start moving my main towards the system. This takes a little while, and the missioner finishes the anom and starts puttering around looting. I started to get pretty pumped as I watch him salvage every wreck in the site, since I think my main will get here in time. He was almost done when my main was one jump out. I decide to try and take him in the site, so I jump my main in and warp to my scout ASAP.\n\nI'm accelerating into my warp when he logs out. I land in the site to see nothing but a few wrecks. It's been long enough that he wont have a combat timer anymore, and my scout doesn't have probes out at the moment, so I decide to plop down at the spot I last saw him and wait.\n\nMaybe it was a coincidental disconnect. Maybe he'll log back in after a few minutes when he thinks I'm gone.\n\n3 minutes go by, and he logs back in.\n\nHe lands like 3km from me. I lock him up and punch my scram key.\n\n\"NAW DUDE\" says my green safety.\n\n\"What?\" says I.\n\nHe's no longer in the corp...\n\nI'm confused for a solid 20 seconds, and then I realize what happened. Checking my contacts I see that his CEO is indeed online. He must have had out of game contact with his CEO, logged off in a panic, and then had his CEO kick him while he was logged.\n\nHe went about his merry way salvaging the rest of the site. My wardec suddenly felt very nonsensical. I couldn't even compel this dude to dock up. I'm trying to figure out how I would fix these mechanics.\n\nHow about:\n\n- If your corp gets dec'd, your members can leave within the 24 hour period before the war goes live, and they'll never be valid war targets\n- If you drop corp in the middle of a war you remain a valid war target for 24 hours, which deactivates the log-and-kick escape hatch that rustled my jimmies\n- Provide a setting so players who don't log in every day can set it up such that they automatically leave a corp that gets dec'd, allowing them to get out in the grace period\n\nThis allows decs to still have a modicum of teeth, without leaving an in-space, practically-zero-downside escape hatch available to all war targets.",
