You don't know the casters for either of the channels (dota2ti1 and dota2ti2) without going into the stream and trying to listen. \n\nCan we please have more proper naming of the channels? Have it seen that the main channel is the multicast while also writing which caster is casting in the different channels, it's annoying to see 4 streams simply named: \"The International 2014.\" Only dota2ti3 is actually named in a good way (still no casters however)",
