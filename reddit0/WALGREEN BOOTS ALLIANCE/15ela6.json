As a nation, we\u2019ve had to deal with a number of challenges - natural disasters like hurricane Sandy and local tragedies, such as the mass shootings in Aurora, CO, Portland, OR and Newtown, CT.  Here at Walgreens, we started our field transformation and we fought the battle with Express Scripts. However, we have had many successes this year. We finished the rollout of our Next Generation registers to 8,000 stores; we launched our new loyalty program, Balance Rewards; we entered into an exciting partnership with Alliance Boots; we converted a number of stores to the Well Experience format; and we opened state-of-the art flagship stores in Chicago and California, with more on the way.  \n\n  \n\nIt\u2019s been a harder year than normal, but we have a lot to celebrate \u2013 and none of this could have been done without you. All of our team members in our stores, our pharmacies, clinics, infusion centers, distribution centers, our call centers, district and corporate offices, at Duane Reade, drugstore.com and USA Drug \u2013 everyone worked together with a common purpose:  to help our customers, get, stay and live well. A big \u201cthank you\u201d for everything you\u2019ve done this past year to take care of our customers and patients.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAs you know, it\u2019s going to be a busy day today and tomorrow.  I\u2019ll be out in stores both days, so if you see me, say \u201chello\u201d.  \n\n \n\n \n\nOn behalf of everyone in Store Operations and Community Management, may you and your family have the happiest of holidays, and a happy, healthy new year!\n\n \n\n\nThanks for your comments.",
