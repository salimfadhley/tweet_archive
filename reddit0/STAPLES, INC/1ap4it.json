I then installed windows 7 onto a different partition so I didnt get all those error messages, now I am looking to just wipe my whole pc, I am not sure how I would do that, the staples software basically makes it difficult to do anything with my 50gb C:\\ drive which I have no control over. Also My laptop will over heat without a fan now, and I believe maybe I have faulty ram on top of that. Any help will be much appreciated!
