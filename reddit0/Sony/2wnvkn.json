  "selftext": "So just over 2 years ago now, was the Playstation 4 announcement where Mark Cerny talked about the Suspend/Resume feature.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/RiNGZMx2vhY?t=23m40s\n\nNow, over the year and a bit that the Playstation was released, Sony have only ever made two public comments about it as far as I am aware, both of which are the typical \"soon\" responses to questions about it.\n\nI have read a few comments by people saying that it is not in the Playstation Software because the core OS that PS4 runs on, BSD, does not support suspend to ram. But I wonder, if BSD didn't support it, why did Sony bother even mentioning it in the first place?\n\nI understand that people cannot expect Sony to do everything when it comes to the system software, but it has been over a year and it just feels like they have done nothing in terms of the system software. I look at posts on /r/games all the time about Microsoft releasing new updates every month with new features, and I understand that Microsoft ARE a software company so it is something they specialize in, but it's not like Sony is a tiny company, it's a multi billion dollar corporation, and yet it feels like they have 1 person working on the firmware. Even the simplest features like a notification for when your friends come online, is still not implemented, all the way through to some majorly requested ones, like DLNA. (Something which in my opinion should have been there day 1.)\n\nIs there a reason for Sony being so slow/quiet about these updates?",
