I'm not going to go in on individual studios since that's a few hundred and most of them are in some way dependent on publishers.\n\n-------------------------\n\nEDIT^3 : I would like to point out that I (at least) have no idea how the decision process works in the ESA, so every single one of the companies might not support these actions by the government. Therefor I would rather we try to inquire/pressure the ESA itself than individual member companies.\n\nWhat you do is, of course, up to yourself.\n\n-------------------------\n\nEDIT^4 [Oh, journalism...](http://www.reddit.com/s/http://geek.pikimal.com/2011/11/18/nintendo-sony-throw-support-behind-censorship-bill/) (Nov 18th 2011 12:49 PM) :D",
