  "selftext": "**My short bio:** \nNarrated by George Takei, Message From Hiroshima provides an inside look at life and culture in the city before the first atomic bomb was dropped.\n\nToday, where the Hon and Motoyasu Rivers meet, stands the Peace Memorial Park \u2013 the former location of the Nakajima district, which was once home to thousands of people and hundreds of businesses. When the first atomic bomb was detonated 2,000 feet above Hiroshima\u2019s city center on August 6, 1945, all of that vanished. Seventy years later, Director Masaaki Tanabe makes it his mission to revive the memory of what once was by interviewing hibakusha (survivors) and former residents. These heart-wrenching testimonials, along with computer-generated recreations of restaurants, shoe stores, cinemas, and the famous Industrial Promotion Hall, recreate the sights, sounds, and smells of a lost culture and people.  \n\nADAM DYKSTRA (Co-Producer) Adam Dykstra is a Walt Disney Feature Animation veteran of 18 years where he worked on 2 shorts and13 features (hand drawn and CG) which include movies such as Tangled, Frozen, Wreck-it Ralph, Princess and The Frog, and Bolt.

In 1991, he accepted a position in California at Film Roman Inc. where he worked on Garfield commercials, The Simpsons and various other TV and feature projects. In 1994, he was offered a position at Disney Feature Animation. In 2008, Dykstra co-wrote and directed a 35mm live-action short, Jack's Gift. A few years later, along with co- producers, Yuriko Senoo and Mark Farquhar, he co-produced and was the recording director for the documentary, Message from Hiroshima (narrated by George Takei). In 2012, he began developing various other live-action projects and in 2014, Dykstra accepted a director position for the feature drama, The Leaves of Eden, starring Barry Corbin which is scheduled for a 2016 release.\n\nYURIKO SENOO (Co-Producer) Yuriko Senoo has worked at Disney for 20 years, initially with Walt Disney Animation Studios as an animator on a host of Disney films, including Tangled, Tick Tock, Bolt, Super Rhino, Meet the Robinsons, Chicken Little, Kangaroo Jack, Reign of Fire, Magic Lamp and Dinosaur.

After hearing John Lasseter speak at a SIGGRAPH conference, she decided to follow in his footsteps, spending a year of graduate school at CalArts School of Film/Video. She earned her MFA in film/video/computer animation from USC School of Cinema-Television.\n\nMARK FARQUHAR (Co-Producer) Mark Farquhar has been working as a CG Character Animator in the animation industry for the last 25 years.
