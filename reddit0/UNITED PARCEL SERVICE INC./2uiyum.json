  "selftext": "_Don't Panic._\n\nToys R' Us uses an economy option from UPS wherein UPS gets the package to your local USPS hub and turns it over for delivery by your mail carrier.  The tracking number you see is _actually_ a USPS tracking number.  The UPS website reads in the information from the USPS tracking, but the USPS tracking isn't active until UPS hands the package over to them.  In my experience, shipping takes 5-7 _full business days_ unless you live in the middle of nowhere (Then it might take a couple more).  Usually by the time the tracking becomes active, it will take a day or two for delivery.  If your order was shipped today, expect it Saturday/Monday.  \n\n\nIt's really a stupid system, but as long as you have shipping confirmation then you should be able to rest easy.  \n\nEdit:  Some people are reporting that the number is valid at FedEx tracking.  TRU is probably just using the cheapest possible option to get it on your doorstep, but if the number begins with something like \"9274\" and has about 22 digits, then they ARE USPS numbers and USPS will provide the most accurate date for delivery when it becomes available.
