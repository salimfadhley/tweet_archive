I could be finished with my degree before I ship, but I want a PLC contract not OCC.\n\nThe assistant OSO says you have to wait until the following calendar year to graduate college after OCS, but that means I would have to put off one class and wait. Yet I've heard that some PLC guys have graduated school immediately after completing OCS. \n\nMy question is: Is it possible to attend PLC 10 week and graduate immediately after? Or will I have to wait? Hope that makes sense.",
