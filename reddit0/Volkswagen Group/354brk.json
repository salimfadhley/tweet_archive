A firetruck, ambulance, and an extremely rare VW dealership &quot;projector&quot; bus. All three are original German &quot;survivors&quot; and have the original paint! There were only a couple &quot;projector&quot; buses made, which have a projector and screen in them that display videos of future VW models coming to the dealership. This is the only one in the world in pristine condition and will one day go in the VW museum. Just a cool piece of history for you guys :)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s some more pics from the collection! <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/KjFdz\">http://imgur.com/a/KjFdz</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
