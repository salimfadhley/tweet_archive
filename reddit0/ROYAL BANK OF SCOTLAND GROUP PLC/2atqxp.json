  "selftext": "I've been doing a bit of research into investing in US companies, and outside of actually opening up an account with a broker that offers international trading, I have come across these two options that reference individual US shares on the ASX:\n\n**Exchange Traded International Securities**, issued by RBS Group (Australia) Pty Limited since May 2011. *[ASX Link](https://www.asxonline.com/intradoc-cgi/groups/participant_services/documents/communications/asx_030222.pdf)*  \n**Exchange Traded Certificates**, issued by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc since May 2012. *[ASX Link](https://www.asxonline.com/intradoc-cgi/groups/participant_services/documents/communications/asx_033548.pdf)*\n\nWhat this essentially means is by investing in one of the listed products, you can gain exposure to the related international shares without the extra costs, paperwork and hassle of trading directly in international markets. Unlike an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) where you invest in a basket of shares, these are each exposed to an individual share. More info about ETIS can be found in this [Google cache of CommSec's newsletter from July 2011](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4ZzTXDqOW5sJ:www.commsec.info/dfnews_jul11/etis.aspx+&cd=1&hl=en).\n\nLooking at descriptions in the ASX links, they both seem to work the same way, except when an ETIS receives a dividend, the issuer takes 50% of it.\n\nAs an example, [here is a link](http://hotcopper.com.au/documentdownload?id=tuE7JrfFgm%2FOGe3hZX2JHW%2FzQkADsA2%2Fmw3%2B14ANkqtzSOrSEdoSXAo1aE6pyAEc32h9PdxMfIq%2Fo9fJAoY3yeEjZA%3D%3D) to the income entitlement distribution for ETSAPL and RBSAPL in relation to Apple's dividend payout in May 2014.\n\nHolders of ETSAPL (an ETIS) got AUD$1.5063/share, whereas holders of RBSAPL (an ETC) got double that at $3.0125/share.\n\nSo what's the catch here? Why would I invest in ETSAPL, when clearly RBSAPL pays more dividends? How does RBSAPL make money for the issuer?\n\nLooking at the trade history for each, RBSAPL does appear to have a higher frequency but lower value for trades. Perhaps this is where they do the skimming?\n\n[ETSAPL trade history for 2014](http://i.imgur.com/qpL4Umo.png)  \n[RBSAPL trade history for 2014](http://i.imgur.com/b6FpVSL.png)",
