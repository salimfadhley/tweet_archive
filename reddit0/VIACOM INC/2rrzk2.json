In 1999, Titan Sports was changed to WWE, Inc, which owned things like the WWF, the XFL, WWF Home Video, etc. Now, WWE, Inc. owns things like WWE Films, the WWE Network, the weekly television shows like Raw, Smackdown, NXT, etc.\n\nThe truth is, the word 'promotion' doesn't really apply to the WWE at all anymore in any capacity. WWE, Inc. is a corporation that owns many different smaller branches. It's similar to the way Viacom owns MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, BET, Comedy Central; or the way Proctor and Gamble owns Crest, Oral-B, Scope, Tide, and Vicks.\n\nThere's no such thing as 'promotions' really anymore, but for the sake of wrestling discussion, you can consider them separate. They have completely separate management, promote their events differently, have different television set ups, camera crews, talent, announcers, venues, offices, etc. They are completely different, they just share a common parent company.",
