And the facts of climate change are not in question anymore. **Everyone understands climate change is occurring and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. And so we should not be aligned with such people \u2014 they're just, they're just literally lying.**\n\n\n\nALEC's response to Google and Schmidt's comments through its chief ~~pathological lair~~ executive, Lisa Nelson:\n\n> It is unfortunate to learn Google has ended its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council as a result of public pressure from left-leaning individuals and organizations who intentionally confuse free market policy perspectives for climate change denial.  ALEC believes in freedom of speech and opinion.\n\n\n## \"It's not illegal to say that\" is the weakest possible defense of having said something\n\nAs [Randall Munroe of xkcd wrote](http://xkcd.com/1357/) some time back:\n\n> **Defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.**\n\n\nAnd that's the best defense ALEC have for their position.\n\n\n## Should Deliberately Deceptive Commercial Speech be Restricted?\n\nIn the 1919 case of _Schenck v. United States_, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man _falsely_ shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.\n\nThis immediately suggests to me the complement: there is just as equally no right to shout \"No Fire!\" in a theater that is, in fact, **on fire**, and all the more so if one gains directly from doing so.  It's a falsehood, and it leads to direct harm -- rather than the stampede to the exits of the false claim, it's death by smoke inhalation and burning alive.\n\nWhich is precisely the state we find the world in today.\n\nAnd it's on that basis, and the fact that not only are ALEC, its members, its supporters, and its fellow disinformation campaigners putting the lives of hundreds of millions if not billions of individual humans at risk, but _all of humanity_, that this is, quite literally, a crime _against_ humanity.  As in _all of it_.\n\nIt's also [grounds for revocation of free speech protections should there be credible proof of deliberate deception](http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/2g8e8c/shouting_no_fire_in_a_warming_world_as_a_clear/).\n\n\n\n## More on ALEC\n\n [SourceWatch' page on ALEC](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Alec) is a good source of additional information:\n\n> ALEC is a corporate bill mill. It is not just a lobby or a front group; it is much more powerful than that. Through ALEC, corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC's operations. They pay for a seat on ALEC task forces where corporate lobbyists and special interest reps vote with elected officials to approve \u201cmodel\u201d bills.
