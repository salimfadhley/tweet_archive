  "selftext": "Revisiting the business logic of Reddit Inc supporting BitCoin\n\nTL;DR Bullet Points:\n\n- Bitcoin services allow merchants to accept btc from customers and instantly convert to USD.\n\n- The BitCoin market has become both stable and liquid; signs that it is beginning to show signs of maturity and critical mass. \n\n- Reddit has an active BitCoin community that will likely immediately support Reddit Inc accepting BC for Reddit Gold. Instant monies. \n\n- Reddit Inc support for its BitCoin community will likely drive more users to those communities. More eyes balls. More ads. More Monies. \n\n- Upside more monies with little downside risk. \n\n- Cool creds.\n\nSo it has been [a year since this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/grz9l/allow_bitcoin_as_an_alternative_payment_for/) was asked. And in that time Bitcoin went through a bubble and pop; but more than that Reddit and Bitcoin are different animals than they were a year ago, so I believe there is value in considering this question again. \n\nFirst, this isn't so random a suggestion. Bitcoin has been receiving alot more coverage and this conversation is a natural flow from that momentum. Reddit's sister site Ars had a great article recently:\n\n- [Porn, gambling, and malware: Bitcoin as the 'Net's Wild West. A year after the bubble popped, we check on the cryptocurrency's progress.](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/porn-gambling-and-malware-bitcoin-as-the-nets-wild-west/)\n\nAnd some other recent coverage:\n\n- [Al-Jazeera English: Understanding Bitcoin](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/05/20125309437931677.html)\n\n- [Bitcoin: Crypto-Anarchism and the Digital Money Revolution](http://www.policymic.com/articles/4980/bitcoin-crypto-anarchism-and-the-digital-money-revolution/category_list)\n\nOkay. Normally, I would go into my evangelist mode and talk about how Bitcoin is important to maintaining freedom of speech online, how it secures the economic bedrock to an eventual free internet, how it develops P2P further, the importance of anonymity blah blah blah BUT I think there is merit in just talking about the economic reasons for Reddit Inc to accept btc for Reddit Gold.\n\nSince accepting btc isn't mutually exclusive to accepting Paypal, this is more a question of how much upside is there for the 1 day it might take to organize. And whether there is enough upside to justify the cost of 1 day? I do believe there is both alot of short and long term financial upside. \n\nFirst, there is very little downside risk. Bitcoin doesn't have a concept for charge backs built in. It also doesn't have a concept of Mastercard screwing everyone for middleman services; and in general your looking at around 1% merchant fees. \n\nThe risk that crashed the market last year, was the result of speculation and volatility. While the market has become more stable and liquid, services like Bit-Pay allow merchants to accept BC from customers and automatically convert it to USD. This removes the volatility risk associated with accepting and holding btc. \n\n- [Bit-Pay Pricing Comparison for E-commerce Sales](https://bit-pay.com/accountingHelp.html)\n\nFor most businesses there's a valid question about whether its existing customers even use Bitcoin. Usually the driver to accept btc is in the hopes of targeting new growth from the BC community. But this question is alot easier for Reddit Inc, we know Reddit has a dynamic and growing BC community. If Reddit were to accept BC, I think it is a fair gamble that Bitcoin redditors will have a higher % of Reddit Gold users than other communities. More or less because Reddit's Bitcoin community is crazy passionate about supporting the growth of Bitcoin. In other words, its a business decision that should show instant monies. \n\n- /r/Bitcoin \n\n- /r/GirlsGoneBitcoin\n\n- /r/BitMarket \n\n- /r/bitcoinmining\n\n- /r/decrypto\n\nIf the move is supported with a blog post supporting Bitcoin; it should also see interest from the wider Bitcoin community. It should begin a new growth snowball for the Reddit BC subs. This is an interesting spot because Bitcoin is likely to be overlooked as a growth opportunity by the other major social media sites. Reddit might hold its own for now in eyeball sucking AdviceAnimal memes but there's plenty of competition from FB, G+, 9gaga, pinterest, twitter, w.e. So while there are specialist BC community sites, its a market that is likely to overlooked. Which is interesting considering they should be high value users, all they do is talk about money. Should reddit be an early adopter, it should cement its position among the majors social media sites for the BC community. In other words, more users, more eyeballs, more monies. \n\nWhile the argument that Reddit Inc would clearly make more monies is airtight /s. This isn't an argument that the Bitcoin market gone mainstream, which is often how the question is framed. Once it is mainstream, it will be obvious to accept btc. But I think the ground is set now that Bitcoin has all the potential to go mainstream. It only needs consumer and business experimentation and adjustment to get there. \n\nI can't attach probabilities to the above; but I think they make sense. But really in the end, this is an argument that Reddit should lead the charge once again for online freedom. Its good for the internet, its good for business. \n\nBonus links:\n\n- [So Bitpay offers instant BC to USD conversions](https://bit-pay.com/accountingHelp.html)\n\n- [MTGox Fee Schedule](https://mtgox.com/fee-schedule)\n\n- https://bitinstant.com/\n\n- http://www.weusecoins.com/\n\n- [Nakamoto, Satoshi. \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\"](http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)",
