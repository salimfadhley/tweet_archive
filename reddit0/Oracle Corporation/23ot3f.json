The price they are settign for this product is under $60 so id guess 59.99.\n\nhttp://www.domarkintl.com/products\n\n**Financials**\n\n10Q April -http://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=9918459\n\n10Q January-http://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=9709901\n\n8k December-http://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=9647774\n\n*Financial Summary*\n\nOne of the main reasons I am interested in this stock and why I think these guys have turned the company around.  The financials have vastly improved since last year.  They are still operating for a loss but in Q1 2013 it was loss of 5.5 million Q1 for 2014 only 440k.  Operational loss for the year went from 7.5 million to 1.5 million. They have also increased assets tremendously to 1.5 million.  With that all loans are being paid on time and they have cash on hand this quarter.\n\n**2nd Main Focus**\n\n*Monetizer 101*\n\nhttp://www.monetizer101.com/\n\nMonetizer 101 Online Shopping Solution (Ownership 100%, North American Distribution Rights) - As announced on 28 January, Monetizer 101 is a unique proprietary technology that collaborates media owners, retailers and consumers into an online discount shopping solution where everyone benefits. Unlike other online shopping platforms currently available, Monetizer 101 is a free advertising model for moving discounted inventory for retailers where they only pay commission for products sold. Media owners will be paid for driving traffic to retailers, retailers receive new revenue streams and increased page views on their own websites and consumers receive a wide variety of brand name products at heavily discounted prices. Progress has been better than we could have ever expected, and the Canadian site is expected to be launched within the next month, with the United States site to follow shortly thereafter. \n\n**Important Information**\n\n**They are finishing up diluting or about to seems to be drying up**\n\nhttp://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=9928810\n\nAbove ^ is a filing from yesterday that is another sign this company is in on the right path.  John M Fife back in January bought 17.5 million shares thats roughly 10% stake in the company. So who is this Mr. Fife.\n\n**John M. Fife**\n\nMr. John M. Fife has been Chairman of United American Healthcare Corp. since October 19, 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and President since November 5, 2010. Mr. Fife served as the President of Chicago Venture Partners, L.P., since 1998. Mr. Fife also served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of ISP Holdings, Inc. He has founded and successfully managed several small businesses. Prior to this, Mr. Fife was an Assistant Vice President of Continental Illinois Venture Corporation and played a key role in the identification, evaluation, and monitoring of control investments in four portfolio companies. Previously, Mr. Fife was a Consultant at Oracle Corporation for three years. Since 2004 he also serves as the Chairman of Pulse Systems, LLC and of Typenex Medical, LLC. He has been a Director of United American Healthcare Corp. since October 1, 2010. He serves on the Boards of Directors of six technology companies and one retail concern. Mr. Fife has served on the Boards of each of the four CIVC portfolio companies. Mr. Fife holds an M.B.A. from the Harvard Graduate School of Business and a dual undergraduate degree in Statistics and Computer Science from Brigham Young University.\n\n\"Venture Corporation and played a key role in the identification, evaluation, and monitoring of control investments in four portfolio companies\"\n\n**THOUGHTS**\n\nThree reason why I like this stock. First the management is solid no scummy past and has definitely turned the business in the right direction since 2012. Second reason their financials have drastically improved since last year in all and for the relevant corresponding quarter.  Third reason JOHN FIFE is a hedge fund manager and this guy looks like he knows when he sees something he likes and think it will succeed.  Why would he buy 17.5 million shares if not.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nForgot to mention they have a tax credit coming to them of $44.6 million\n\n *Products are mass market with large margins creating a real asset value that is substantially higher than officially posted. The Company also has a $44.6 million carry forward tax loss which will be very valuable when DoMark's transitions into a profitability in the very near future.*\n\n http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/DOMK/news\n\nTWITTER:SKITHEG",
