  "selftext": "Another update was filed in the docket on Monday which specifically responds to the request for Dismissal. You can view the document here:\n\nhttps://search.rpxcorp.com/litigation_documents/10864942\n\nI made this a text post so that I could share a few choice passages from this new entry:\n\n> Cryptozoic employees repeatedly logged into Wizards\u2019 servers to play and to copy the Magic game. The servers, owned by the Renton-based plaintiff, Wizards of the Coast are located within the Western District of Washington. By these repeated log-ins, Cryptozoic\u2019s employees used Cryptozoic\u2019s computers to review and to copy the Magic Online game; the employees were moving intellectual property from servers residing within the forum district, transmitting it down to Cryptozoic\u2019s headquarters in central California.\n\nThis is Wizards argument for having the case tried in Washington State. In their request for dismissal, Cryptozoic claimed that Wizards had no jurisdiction over Cryptozoic. Wizards is claiming that because Cryptozoic copied Magic from Wizards servers, which are based in Renton, that the case can be tried in Washington.\n\n>Cryptozoic has so pervasively copied the Magic game in publishing Hex, that the number of instances of infringement is monumental. In fact, the Hex cards so completely mimic the Magic cards that they could be interspersed into a deck of Magic cards without notice by players when engaged in game play.\n\nOkay, that's a bit of a stretch. Obviously people would notice the difference. However, you could probably keep playing the game without missing a beat.\n\nAt this point it seems obvious that the narrative Wizards legal team is going to put forth is that the designers of Hex logged into Magic Online or Gatherer, downloaded all the card information, and used it to create their design templates for Hex.\n\nI know that a lot of you have had some good debates with me over the past few days and that the crux of those debates has been the copying of mechanics. Wizards legal team seems to be, at least as far as I can tell, avoiding the issue of mechanics. Instead, they're going to focus on the idea that Hex is Magic, and that they did not copy the mechanics, they copied the game in its entirety.\n\nThe rest of the amendments cite a bunch of precedents about why Wizards has the right to file suit in Washington, and why Cryptozoic's request for dismissal is invalid.\n\n>To prove copyright infringement, a plaintiff must establish both: \u201c(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\u201d Feist Publ\u2019ns v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282 (1991) (citing Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 548, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985)); see also Ford Motor Co. v. Summit Motor Prods., Inc., 930 F.2d 277, 290 (3d Cir. 1991). Thus, to bring an action for copyright infringement the plaintiff must assert a copyright registration. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411 (2004) In the Amended Complaint and the fully incorporated Appendix 1 to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has asserted exactly that, 107 times. Such a registration is prima facie evidence that the holder owns a valid copyright to the work in question. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c); see also Ford Motor, 930 F.2d at 290. With the allegation of a copyright registration, the burden shifts to the defendant to disprove validity but for purposes of the 12(b)(6) motion, the allegation alone is sufficient. Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic Int\u2019l, Inc., 685 F.2d 870, 873 (3d Cir. 1982).\n\nThere's a lot going on in that paragraph but the crux of it is that precedent exists that once Wizards identifies a valid copyright and that original elements have been copied. I have a feeling where they're hoping to catch Hex is with the wording of specific cards and the type lines.\n\nI don't know if Wizards will win this suit, but I have a feeling they've presented enough to avoid a dismissal.",
