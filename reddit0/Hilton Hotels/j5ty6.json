  "selftext": "Hi all! I apologize in advance for any typos - this is from my phone. My clanmate never came back to the room last night and it caused me to miss my flight. I rebooked my flight for a hurtful price - I have alternative routes but I have a lot of belongings in his car. Our other clanmate needs to get back to Santa Barbara by 1pm.\n\nBut nevermind that - we aren't worried about this as much as his well-being. \n\nHe was last seen at the Hilton hotel party on the fifth floor before getting broken up around 3ish. He was at fire and ice before that if that helps.\n\nHe's a 6'4\" white guy with dark hair and glasses. Long-sleeved collared white shirt. Loud voice, like he's talking in caps lock. He might've been talking about white ra, his camera, keyboards, his car, or terran being imba. This is starting to sound trollish and I apologize - he has a loud voice so if you didnt see him, you might have heard him.\n\nWe were expecting him to come back last night but he never showed up and his phone is dead. We have to check out of the hotel in less than an hour.\n\nIf anyone can help or has any advice, we'd really appreciate it.\n\nThanks ^_^ \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 11:04am**************\n\nthanks for the legitimate advice and wit <3\n\nwe called the local police department and it turns out he's been detained. they wouldn't tell us what he was arrested for or what time it happened, but it will be a $500 bail. and they won't let us get him for another four hours. if anyone is still around and wants to play sc2 for the time being (there are five of us here - diamonds/masters), let us know!\n\nremoved some of his info for privacy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 2:01pm**************\n\nwe tried bailing him out earlier, but\n\n> \"um, he's not ready yet. he's still, um, drunk.\"\n\nI'll give updates later about what the fuck happened, but I do know that he lost his glasses. thanks everyone for the help and concern! and jokes. don't wall yourself in at mlg, guys.\n\nalso, we're at a lan center nearby. gtsquee.877 if you want to play some games ^_^\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 2:42pm**************\n\nwe heard from him:\n\n> \"I wound up hogtied on the floor.\"\n\nand it sounded like the last thing he remembered was taking shots with white ra. playing 1v1 obs games right now will brb. to clarify, we don't really know what he meant by that. the phone call he made was extremely expensive and he skimped on a lot of details because he claimed to not remember much. I'll try to get more out of him when we pick him up.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 3:10pm**************\n\nwe got back in touch with the station. we're leaving the lan center to try to pick him up now. thanks everyone for the nice messages on bnet :]\n\nwe have to leave before he gets transferred to county. we'll take pictures.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 4:00pm**************\n\nposted this information around 4pm in the comments:\n> I can't update the post on my phone, but we got him out. He has bruises and there's blood on his shirt. Maybe if I say he has that handsome rugged look going on, he won't be too upset about me posting the videos. We are in two cars right now, picking up his car at the hotel. More updates soon.\n\n> The last thing he remembers is crossing the street with white ra after the Hilton party. After that, he was getting arrested. The report says he was arrested at 6am. Definitely missing a huge part of the story, but it would have to come from the people who were actually with him.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 8:00pm**************\n\n[comment from my friend who was missing](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/j5ty6/my_friend_went_missing_at_mlg_can_anyone_help/c29i6ru):\n> As the guy who went missing, I have to say I have amazing friends. I cannot thank them enough for finding me and getting me out, wasting many, many hours of their time and a great deal of money.\nI apologize to them for my lack of control. I also feel I owe the community an apology for making a fool of myself.\nWhile I can't remember anything, no doubt I burned bridges. I heard I was more than obnoxious as well.\nSo, I am sorry to those that had to deal with me last night. And I thank the community for helping my friends in this.\nAnd I especially thank squeeeee for all she did in this, and I must apologize for failing as a friend.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**************UPDATE 1:20am**************\n\nfinally back in the bay area. thanks to everyone in the g+ huddle, \"gosutrolling,\" team is, wp, reddit, tl, and the anaheim police department. (and round table pizza for the 4 XL pizzas.)\n\nif anyone was with my friend between the hours of 3am and 6am, it would be great if you could get in touch with me. we're dying to know what the hell really happened.\n\n**what to take away:**\n\n* be careful of walling yourself in at MLG\n* don't try to drink white-ra under the table\n* ESPORTS\n\n\n**multimedia delivered (with his permission):**\n\n* [first attempt at bailing him out](http://i.imgur.com/fX1dJ.jpg)\n* [he's freeeeee - with other clanmate and random chick](http://i.imgur.com/N2ADW.jpg)\n* [moments after being released](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CslkIOukt8I) [VIDEO]",
