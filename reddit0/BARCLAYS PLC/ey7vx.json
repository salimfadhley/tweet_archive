  "selftext": "Let's resuscitate investit. I wanted to run some value plays by the community to see if we can sort through some of the muck. I have picked three European banks trading under 20$ USD -- all of them have recently posted a positive EPS, have a PE ratio under 11, market cap of >2B, and, most importantly, trade for < book value. I have ordered them from most to least risk.\nBank of Ireland. IRE trades at $2.37, posted a positive EPS ($0.32) while everyone else in its sector was posting negative EPS, has a PE ratio of 7.5. The most impressive aspect of this buy, though, is it's PB ratio 0.07. You can buy a dollar of assets for seven cents without compromising earnings. Total debt to assets? 3.34. Concerns: in order to meet 2.2B euro capitalization requirements in February, new shares may be issued, causing untoward dilution.\nBanco Santander. STD trades at $9.90, posted an EPS of $1.25. It's ratios are not quite so impressive as IRE (PE 7.89, PB 0.96), but its financial position is much better -- market cap is 81.3B to IRE's 3.14B. It is impressive especially because of its continued dividends and international exposure -- it can touch Brazil and other parts of Latin America. I am worried, though, because it has a lot of debt (debt to assets of 21.91).\nFinally, the most expensive play: Barclays PLC. BCS trades at $17.12 and posted an EPS of $1.67 for a PE ratio of 10.24. PB ratio is 0.68. Market cap: 51.51B. It's shielded from exposure to the Euro (it's in the UK), and pays a modest dividend. Over the long term, how can Barclays not recover?\nIn conclusion, I think I have put forward a reasonable play. A very modest investment in any or all of these banks could pay off handsomely in the long run.\nInvestit: your thoughts!",
