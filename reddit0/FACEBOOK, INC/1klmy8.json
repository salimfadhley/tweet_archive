As circlejerky as the latter may be, there tend to be a few good threads about actual technology I&#39;d rather not miss out on, and the two subreddits don&#39;t usually intersect in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely enough, early this morning I saw <a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1kkvei/user_reports_security_bug_to_facebook_after_user/\">this post</a> about a Facebook vulnerability report.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"/r/netsec\">/r/netsec</a>: the point of origin</h4>\n\n<p>To summarize the post in short, the reporter made an unauthorized post on a real person&#39;s wall instead of using test accounts provided by Facebook for white-hat hackers, and simply sends a link to the post instead of any steps to reproduce it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i would like to report a bug in your main site (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">www.facebook.com</a>) which i discovered it .</p>\n\n<p>repro:\nthe bug allow facebook users to share links to other facebook users , i tested it on sarah.goodin wall and i got success post\nlink - &gt; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/10151857333098885\">https://www.facebook.com/10151857333098885</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Facebook security employee that received it stated it wasn&#39;t a bug report, along with two other people who received the report. He then makes <em>another</em> unauthorized post to Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s wall this time, and releases the details of the exploit on his personal blog.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/netsec\">/r/netsec</a> brings up the fact that there were no actual steps to reproduce the bug, and in fairness to the employees dealing with the response, if you actually look at what the exploit reporter wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the bug allow facebook users to share links to other facebook users</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It makes complete sense to close it saying that it is a feature.</p>\n\n<p>Before moving on to <a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a>&#39;s post, note the link that <a href=\"/r/netsec\">/r/netsec</a> uses, linking directly to the exploit post from the original author instead of a third-party article. The title appears to be jerky, but the comments actually do a good job at elaborating on <em>why</em> it wasn&#39;t a proper report, and why the user did not give any actual steps for reproducing a bug.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1kkvei/user_reports_security_bug_to_facebook_after_user/cbpyhqq\">The top comment in /r/netsec:</a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is pretty dumb. The person reporting the vulnerability didn&#39;t describe it at all, they just said &quot;hey, look at this guy&#39;s wall.&quot; and expected the security team to figure it out. They didn&#39;t report anything. You can&#39;t expect to get credit for a vulnerability if you can&#39;t communicate what it is to the company. <em><a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1kkvei/user_reports_security_bug_to_facebook_after_user/cbpyhqq\">(+144/-30)</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are replies that do contest that Facebook did patch the vulnerability indirectly because of him, but for the most part they actually discuss the vulnerability and debate whether or not it was proper procedure.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a>: the article</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kkoux/hacker_posts_facebook_bug_report_on_zuckerbergs/\">Here is the same post</a> spun into an RT article, posted on the <a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a> reddit. The article does link to the original blog post, but unless readers actively read that article as well, there are some critical details left out.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at the article itself first. Sentence #1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Palestinian information system expert</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Oh fuck no.</em></strong> I had not even gotten past the beginning of the first sentence and I knew this was going to be a loaded article. The guy graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree in Information Systems fairly recently, so he&#39;s knowledgeable, but an <em>expert</em>? Debateable.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing on:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Palestinian information system expert says he was forced to post a bug report on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page after the social network\u2019s security team failed to recognize that a critical vulnerability he found allows anyone to post on someone&#39;s wall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay, and to the average user this seems like a major issue, right? Except, read earlier on, he never actually disclosed any details about the vulnerability. His report didn&#39;t even specify that his post was on a wall of someone he wasn&#39;t friends with, or that he managed to circumvent privacy settings. What he said boiled down to &quot;I made a post on someone&#39;s wall. This is a bug. Fix it.&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, the social network\u2019s security team failed to acknowledge the bug, even though Khalil enclosed a link to a post he made on the timeline of a random girl who studied at the same college as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It gets even more loaded. It wasn&#39;t stated in the bug report that it was just a random target, and still yet, he violated the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whitehat\">Facebook White Hat</a> program right off the bat by using actual people as targets instead of the unlimited test accounts that could be made for free.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a>: the jerk</h4>\n\n<p>It&#39;s established that there are pretty important pieces of information missing between the blog post from the exploiter himself and the RT article. Maybe <a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a> will have some sense and actually see that it wasn&#39;t a proper channel, right? Right?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They should pay him. He could have sold that for a ton of money to spammers. <a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kkoux/hacker_posts_facebook_bug_report_on_zuckerbergs/cbpzk5h\"><em>(+756/-123)</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nope.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether or not it could have been sold to spammers, does that even justify paying the guy solely on that basis? If you had contacted Facebook saying &quot;I can log into this account. It is a bug.&quot; and then logged directly into someone else&#39;s account using an exploit, do you expect to get paid? Hopefully not.</p>\n\n<p>Still, that comment by itself isn&#39;t so bad. It was a possibility and the guy at least tried to contact Facebook, and maybe that&#39;ll be reflected in the rest of the comments as well. <a href=\"/r/technology\">/r/technology</a> is jerky, but it can&#39;t be jerk overload.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh for fuck sake, pay the guy his $500. Facebook Inc. brings in over $50,000,000 annually. Fuck! <em>(+326/-61)</em>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>500 is for minor bugs. This isn&#39;t minor. <em>(+214/-27)</em>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, $0. Good policy. <a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kkoux/hacker_posts_facebook_bug_report_on_zuckerbergs/cbq4dey?context=2\"><em>(+205/-35)</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Goddamn.</h3>\n\n<p>This is where the generic reddit anti-corporatism comes in, a member of the <a href=\"http://ds.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/\">snowflaking jerk beta</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, Facebook makes loads of money that can be spent on blow and hookers googol times over and still have enough left to screw bug reporters out of their money, but no one seems to acknowledge that there simply wasn&#39;t enough information to do anything about it, and that it was only discovered when he specifically exploited Facebook&#39;s own CEO.
