It has three main branches: Pearson Education, Financial Times Group, and Penguin (Book) Group.  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d like to take a moment here to remind us of one of the biggest complaints we hear from students: the price of textbooks.  They\u2019re expensive, required, and already last year\u2019s edition by the time you buy them.  We have the technology to do away with paper books to an extent- heck, we have the technology, resources, and willingness to deliver content in a much more open-source, community-centered manner through wikis and such- but we\u2019re still using textbooks.  Hey, whose business is it to publish books?  And whose business is it to determine content?\nHmm.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at their history, it picks up in the 21st century.  \u201cIn September 2000, Pearson acquired National Computer Systems (NCS, Inc.) and entered the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United states. \u2026in 2003 it secured control of Edexcel\u201d, which is the company that awards certifications and qualifications.   But wait, it can\u2019t be that bad, can it?  Who awards teacher certifications?  </p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see, I took the New York State Teacher Certification Examinations\u2122, which were published by\u2026 well, I couldn\u2019t seem to find that information, but the Praxis exams which certify teachers in other states is published by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which apparently is criticized for being a \u201chighly competitive business operation that is as much multinational monopoly as nonprofit institution\u201d.[38] Due to its legal status as a non-profit organization, ETS is exempt from paying federal corporate income tax on many, but not all, of its operations. Furthermore, it does not need to report financial information to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201c Well that\u2019s bothersome.  And a quick google search of \u201cETS and Pearson\u201d comes up with this:\n\u201cBeginning in January 2006, the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) will be administered by Pearson VUE, the electronic exam delivery subsidiary of the global conglomerate Pearson, which is also responsible for scoring the SAT I \u201cWriting\u201d exam essay section.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So Pearson is actively acquiring other certification/qualification exams.\n(<a href=\"http://www.fairtest.org/ets-loses-sat-writing-test-contract\">http://www.fairtest.org/ets-loses-sat-writing-test-contract</a> )</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what sparked this little investigation: I received an email from Commissioner King about the current goings on in NYSED and such.  At the bottom of the message, past the fold and pretty graphics, was the headline \u201cNotes\u201d.<br/>\n\u201cOn June 1, 2013, NYSED released the New York City Teacher and Principal Evaluation Plan. Legislation enacted earlier this year mandated that NYSED impose an Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) plan for any district without an approved plan in place by May 29.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>So if you don\u2019t have an approved plan by May 29th, they\u2019ll pick one for you.  Ok.  Then, further down, an invitation to field test the School Building Leader Assessment (SBL), which, when I go to the page (<a href=\"http://www.nystce.nesinc.com/fieldtest.asp\">http://www.nystce.nesinc.com/fieldtest.asp</a> )  , I find out is actually a New York State Teacher Certification Examination and- Oh no.  Oh no, oh no.  You can participate in this pilot test at Pearson Authorized Test Centers.  That can\u2019t possibly mean that Pearson wrote the NYSTCE tests, can it?  But then, a link on the page brings me to this:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Evaluation Systems group of Pearson develops standards-based, criterion-referenced teacher licensure testing programs. Evaluation Systems provides states with a wide variety of teacher licensure services such as test development, administration, and scoring and collaborates with state education agencies and teacher preparation programs to provide support for prospective teachers preparing to take the exams.\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.pearsonvue.com/espilot/\">http://www.pearsonvue.com/espilot/</a> )</p>\n\n<p>Pearson awarded me my teaching certificate.  And I\u2019ll be teaching with Pearson\u2019s materials, to the tests that- no, Pearson doesn\u2019t write the standardized tests for students, does it?\nBut it does.  According to this article, \u201cPearson has a five-year, $32 million contract to create tests for the state\u201d for students.  (<a href=\"http://gothamschools.org/2013/04/22/pearsons-nyc-misstep-draws-state-education-officials-concern/\">http://gothamschools.org/2013/04/22/pearsons-nyc-misstep-draws-state-education-officials-concern/</a> )</p>\n\n<p>Why is no one outraged at this?  Pearson has a monopoly- not a monopoly on goods, services, or resources, but a monopoly on minds.  They control what is taught, how it\u2019s taught, what materials are used, and who teaches it.  Maybe there\u2019s some wiggle room for style and personality, but in the end, we\u2019re all playing by Pearson\u2019s rules.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m horrified, and terrified. \nThoughts?  Reassurance that it\u2019s not that bad?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
