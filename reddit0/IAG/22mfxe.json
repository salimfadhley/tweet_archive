The match begins. Great atmosphere.\n\n2' Ribery hits it off Jones for the first corner of the match.\n\n3' Robben crosses the ball in, looking for Muller, who clashes heads with Smalling. Both players down for a short time.\n\n5' Corner gets swung in and Ribery gets on the rebounded ball for a shot from just outside the box. Hits the ground and misses to the left.\n\n7' Rooney is onside with a decent chance for United. Seems hesitant, looks left for Kagawa but its blocked, tries to get the shot off, it's blocked, goes sky-high and then clashes heads with Dante as it comes down.\n\n12' Good chance for Bayern! Robben takes a shot and it goes just left of the post.\n\n15' Bayern continue to put of the pressure, and Robben tries it again. Another miss though.\n\n16' Valencia gets on the end of a cross and puts it in the net, but was quite far off-side.\n\n20' Bayern cut through United but Rib\u00e9ry is caught offside from a Gotze through-ball.\n\n24' Welbeck finally gets his boots sorted. Just after Alaba hits it high and wide from a decidedly wild effort.\n\n25' Rooney is being heavily booed whenever he picks up the ball. Gets it to Kagawa who is tackled at the halfway line.\n\n27' [](//#yellow) Vidic is shown a yellow for a foul.\n\n32' Big bout of Bayern pressure here, as expected some would say. United trying to catch them on the break.\n\n37' Untied almost caught short from a very quick corner taken by Bayern. Ball gets pushes out and Kroos tries a shot but it's over the bar.\n\n38' Evra taken down by Lahm on the left side. Replays show that it was a clear foul but nothing was given. Evra is down for a while, the ball is knocked out so he can receive treatment, and he walks off the pitch.\n\n40' Evra is back.\n\n43' Robben takes the ball across the box and tries to get a shot off. He eventually does but it's blocked and goes for a corner.\n\n45' +1 minute added time. \n\n45' [](//#whistle-big)  The teams go into the tunnel for half-time.\n\n45'  [](//#whistle-big)   The second-half begins.\n\n46' Smalling is down in Bayern's box and the ball is knocked-out so he can receive treatment.\n\n47' Three corners in quick succession. United, United, then Bayern take the last one.\n\n51' Bayern pressure is building up again. Vidic with some nice defending to block a shot.\n\n\n54' Kagawa with a shot from outside the box, but it's saved.\n\n55' Bad clash in the middle of the pitch. Man United win a fre-kick.\n\n57' [](//#ball-big) [**GOAL! Fantastic goal! Evra with an absolute belter of a shot from outside the box. Left footed into the top right corner. Lovely stuff.

Not sure if he thought he was offside or just hit it wrong, but a massive lack of power leads to a squandered chance for United. Goes wide left.\n\n61' G\u00f6tze with a nice header, but De Gea saves it.\n\n62' Free-kick to Bayern for a vidic foul.\n\n64' [](//#up) Rafinha [](//#down)  G\u00f6tze.\n\n67' Man United sustaining some heavy Bayern pressure.\n\n67' [](//#ball-big)  [**GOAL!

This is as long as Bayern do not score again.\n\n69' [](//#yellow)  Evra given a yellow for a foul on Robben in United's half. Ribery gets shirty and barges Evra as he's taking to the ref and gets a stern talking to.\n\n72' [](//#yellow)  Rafinha is shown a yellow card (for timewasting?)\n\n73' [](//#up) Hern\u00e1ndez  [](//#down)  Fletcher\n\n74' [**GOAL! Bayern make it 3-1 through a Robben goal! He dribbles across the box and gets a left-footed shot off. A slight deflection of Vidic is all it takes to send it past De Gea**](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T60fXdKsAaM/U0WrKZBl6OI/AAAAAAAACEY/Ze9kYllrahs/s0/09-04-2014-GifNumber-273.gif). **4-2 on aggregate** Is it over for United? My mind says Yes but my heart wishes No.\n\n77' Robben with a handball and Rooney with a foul shortly after.\n\n80' [](//#up) Januzaj [](//#down)  Welbeck\n\n81' Smalling concedes a corner.\n\n83' [](//#up) Pizarro [](//#down)  M\u00fcller\n\n86' United seeming to lack the drive to get anything back. Valences gives it to Rooney from the right, whose shot it blocked by the bodies in Bayern's box.\n\n86' Valencia delivers a cross but its too far back for Hernandez and is easily cleared.\n\n87' Ribery finds Pizarro who shrugs off Vidic, turns, and gets a decent, but weakish shot off. De Gea clutches it easily.\n\n89' Determined run by Valencia diagonally towards the box, who ploughs through some Bayern players. Bayern free-kick awarded.\n\n90' Fourth official indicates **+3 minutes of added time**\n\n [](//#whistle-big) Full-Time whistle blows. Bayern advance with a 4-2 aggregate victory (3-1 on the night)",
