I told her to not do anything risky with our money until I graduate college (currently a high school junior, going to apply to UCs) but she's ignoring me. I really just want to get a job out of college and support myself, and then she can do whatever she wants with the rest. \n\nShould I stop this? I need some solid evidence that its safer in the bank. Or am I just over reacting? Lemme know reddit.  ",
