It seems to be ridiculously high for what actually happens behind the scenes. Honestly... The things I have seen Audi do and the things I have been told to do by Audi curators them self, just doesn't justify the costs involved!\n\nI made [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E7JR2PnyAM) which is in reality... all that an Audi technician does with your car. Obviously they do a little further inspection... But really... that is what you pay for!\n**MAKE SURE YOU HEAD OVER THERE AND COMMENT ON ANY TUTORIALS AND KNOWLEDGE YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW/SEE!**\n\nBut being an Audi.. Automatically the price for oil is higher, the filter costs are higher and so on.\n\nWould just like an input from some Audi owners, I feel that you guys are being **Ripped Off** with the amount of repair/service costs. I am hoping to find some support with a new project/idea I have.\n\nI am looking to create videos on YouTube to assist Audi owners in fixing/servicing their own cars for half the cost! Obviously an Audi is very computer controlled, so not everything will be able to be repaired physically. \n\nI am also willing to offer all the knowledge i have to answer any **Audi/Skoda** questions you may have! \n\nI just started the YouTube channel which I called [The Tube Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4EA90u-XSm9eDY6jLAVnw) which is purely dedicated to help others from what i have learnt and I hope it will help you all out as well!\n\n**If you have any questions, please comment on my videos!
