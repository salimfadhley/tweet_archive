Of the top of my head, I can think of 2... [tarik](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=177&playerid=8523&eventid=1666) before [he used a team timeout to switch to the M4A1-S](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3hpqfo/clg_disconnected_to_change_the_m4a4_to_the_m4a1s/cu9f3ux), [friberg](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=177&playerid=7148&eventid=1666) who went a [combined 61/89 K/D](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=179&teamid=4411&eventid=1666) and was generally an anchor on NiP, and [shox](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=177&playerid=1225&eventid=1666), [who went 44/43](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=175&playerid=1225&eventid=1666), not a very shoxie-like performance (he also used the M4A1-S). *If I missed anyone, please let me know in the comments!*\n\nIn the past, Valve has looked mostly at metrics from both everyday games and professional games to determine which direction they need to push to balance weapons.  *While I personally would love to be able to buy both weapons at all time,* I don't think Valve will implement this. So, since we know how imbalanced the two M4's are at the professional level, we should discuss how to bring them closer together.\n\nThe first part of the discussion is whether the A1 should be nerfed, the A4 buffed, or a little bit of both. I think in general, CT side is still rather strong in CS:GO, so I would lean towards nerfing the A1-S (VERY SLIGHTLY) to bring them more in line and slightly nerf CT side, with very slight buffs to the M4A4.\n\nMy proposed changes: nerf M4A1-S running inaccuracy, from current **127.35->143.38**, equal to the M4A4's running inaccuracy (AK-47 = 182.07). Swap \"Damage Falloff\" values between M4A4 and A1-S (M4A1-S: **1% per 500 units -> 3% per 500 units** || **M4A4: 3% per 500 units -> 1% per 500 units**).\n\nSome have also proposed increasing penetration (wallbanging) potential of the M4A4. Currently, all the non-sniper rifles (and the Deagle) have 200% penetration power, and all the sniper rifles have 250% penetration power. So, if there was a change in penetration power for the M4A4, it would have to be very slight. I would rather they fleshed out the penetration system a little more than made a change to only the M4A4's penetration power.\n\nAnyway, tell me how wrong I am below. If you think there needs to be a change, I'd love to hear how you guys would change the M4A1-S and the M4A4.",
