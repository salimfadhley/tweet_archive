  "selftext": "I got a PM a few days ago from someone in r/seduction about my time working at Abercrombie & Fitch. \n\n...Overall I didn't make much, wasn't a huge fan of their clothing, and due to allergies was constantly plugged up due to the smell BUT it was a perfect training ground.\n\nPart of the job, that's insinuated not told, is that flirting sells. This, of course, applies to all sales. Especially in clothing. These are some of the techniques I used then and that I still use today.\n\n**1. Don't Be New** - This is something that I hear little about around r/seduction but has been incredibly effective for me.\n\n...This involves seeing a girl, before she sees you, that strikes your interest. You walk by, I'd often do this carrying clothing or going off to fold, so that she sees you (but doesn't think that you've seen her).\n\nYou're now consciously (if she was checking you out) or subconsciously (you were in her gaze, but she wasn't checking you out) in her mind. Whether it's conscious or not doesn't matter. What does matter is that you are no longer completely foreign to her (whether she knows it or not). \n\nThis will always make the girl you're interested in more comfortable when you begin to talk to her. This is very applicable on college campuses. If she has seen you, she'll feel more comfortable knowing you're not a complete stranger.\n\n**2. Frame Her** - I was told this by my manager when I first began. When talking you want to engulf her frame of view without being in her face. \n\n...You do this by forming a V with your feet, with a wide stance. Ideally, if there's something by her (table, bar, chair, etc) you want to make it so that to the left there's something, to the front and right you're completely in the frame (by making the V), and the only open space is from behind.\n\nThis gives the perception of just talking but makes you the focal point. It also makes it tougher for people to disengage the conversation (since they have to either step back or walk backwards). \n\nThis works well in all settings. Try doing this at work. Body language is not just how you control your body from the waist up, by standing upright, but also by how you frame conversations.\n\n**3. Leave Early but Come Back Often** - By framing you're asserting an implied level of dominance. By leaving early you're showing that you're in control of the interactions.\n\n...If you're at a house party and as soon as you see the conversation is dwindling eject. Go get yourself together, think of good topics, and then place yourself back in.\n\nIdeally you want to recognize what the peak of your conversation would be (in terms of her interest in you and your conversation) and then eject. Not eject while the conversation itself is fading. \n\nWith practice it becomes quite easy to tell when you're about to hit this peak. \n\n**4. Compliment What's She's Done, Not Her** - Between r/askwomen and r/seduction there's a bit of a discrepancy when it comes to randomly hitting on girls.\n\n...r/Seduction normally goes with a general statement about her (i.e - I had to stop you because you're so cute) while r/askwomen always stress that they want to hear what they've done that makes them cute (i.e - I love your style, hair, whatever).\n\nAn employee first taught me this using the explanation that most women, like men, know their base attractiveness. They know that they're a 6, 7, or whatever. \n\n...Trying to tell them that they're a 9 based solely on \"looks\" most recognize is a thinly veiled attempt to get with them.\n\nBut telling them what makes them so attractive is something they are actively putting effort into (style, hair, even body) makes them (girls and guys I'd add) feel like they're reaching above that base attractiveness which is what everyone tries to do.\n\nOf course, a reason we did this at Abercrombie is because everyone coming in was buying relatively expensive, usually revealing clothing. Buying into a very sex-driven atmosphere.\n\n**5. Side Talk is the Best Talk** - We had to walk a fine line, especially since most employees were over 18 and our average cliental was in the 15-25 range.\n\nOur stores always tried to convey an intimiate feel: dark rooms, soft lighting, loud but soothing music, and \"fragrance\" everywhere. \n\nBut whispering in ears goes a little too far. So what many would utilize is side talk. It's when, due to how loud the room is or whatever, you lean to one side, slightly lean forward and talk.\n\nThis isn't intimiate, you aren't *really* getting much closer, but you're initiating a position related to intimacy. You may be making her more insecure by not speaking directly to her. And, if you're wearing cologne on your neck, she'll get a slight whiff of it perhaps (although that's redundant in our stores, I know). \n\n**6 - Your Eyes Say It All** - Eye contact is always a major factor. But I'll be a bit more specific. Again, advice from an older co-worker.\n\nYou *always* want to keep eye contact. You should initiate with eye contact and not break it until she looks away. Eye contact is always the first prelude to intimacy. \n\nBUT, even if you're the most attractive guy in the world, too much eye contact, especially in the wrong setting, can be a bit odd/creepy. \n\nSo how do you break eye contact without breaking the intimacy that you've built up?\n\nDon't look to the side! She'll think you're looking at someone behind her, or to her side.\n\nDon't look down! It's a sign that you've lost interest, she makes you uncomfortable, or that you're shy (which isn't inherently a bad thing).\n\nLook just slightly *above* her. This breaks the eye contact but nothing is implied by looking above her. Especially if you're taller this could just be you stretching your neck. But it does break the *feeling* of eye contact so you can reinitiate it. \n\n**7. The In and Out** - No, this is not about burgers. No, this is not about sex.\n\n...This is something I first picked up from the movie Alfie (the new one, with Jude Law, great movie by the way if you haven't seen in) and shared with some friends/co-workers.\n\nYou should, in most settings, never crowd the individual your talking to unless it's at a party or club. You should be a good foot or so away, at least initially. \n\nWhen you're telling her a joke, or telling her a little secret, walk half-a-step towards her (still framing her), bend forward (if she's shorter than you) just a tad, and say your joke/secret/whatever and then step back smiling. \n\nThis works *really* well with sarcasm. I'd normally say, \"Can I tell you a secret about this store?\" She'd say, \"Yes?\" and I'd lean in saying, \"We actually spray cologne in here all the time. It doesn't just naturally smell this way\" then I'd lean out. This would always get a \"Oh, *realllly* I never would've guessed\" type response. \n\nBreaking intimacy, like you break off conversations as discussed in point 3, is really effective. By saying you're telling her a secret and leaning in you're building intimacy, making her heart beat a bit quicker, and then quickly snapping it by telling a sarcastic joke instead of a true secret. \n\n**That's it...**\n\nSo that's it. Hopefully these help you out a bit. I still think about them and apply them whenever I'm out and about. Doesn't matter the setting.\n\n\n",
