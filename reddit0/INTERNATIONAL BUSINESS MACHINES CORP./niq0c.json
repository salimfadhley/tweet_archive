We'll post my video responses to the top ten questions on Wednesday.\n\nA little bit about myself - I began my career in the field of materials science where I did work in semiconductor research, including leading the IBM team of researchers that developed silicon-germanium (SiGe) technology. I have a Ph.D. in physics from New York\u2019s City College, and have more than 180 published papers and over 40 patents, and our work with SiGe is helping to turn the vision of pervasive computing into reality.\n\nEvery year at IBM, we release our [\u201c5 in 5\u201d predictions](http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2011/12/ibm-5-in-5-people-power-will-come-to-life.html), in which we forecast five innovations which will alter the tech landscape in the coming five years.
