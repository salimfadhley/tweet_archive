  "selftext": "So we found out last night that my girlfriend and I are going to be parents. I'm pretty terrified and nervous, as is she. We are both twenty (21 in december), full time students in our junior years of college, and both have two jobs. I myself am very involved in my program at school and work at O'Reilly Auto Parts part time as well as working for Ford Motor, Co. She works at an elementary school and a daycare facility and is in an early childhood program. We have been together for almost three years (will be three years this november) and love each other very much. \n\nWe both drive sports cars (BMW 3 series and Mustang) and neither of us have a lot of money saved up. I currently have four hundred dollars as I just spent 600 on an older pickup that I am going to get running to use as a farm truck. I guess it goes without saying to start saving every penny we make? Is there a certain way we should go about that? We are both on our parents' insurance plans. How much should we expect the hospital bills to be? Is there anything else we should be prepared to spend money on other than the usual food and diapers, etc.? Thank you for any input. \n\nEdit: the cars are both paid off, neither are new either. ",
