  "selftext": "Streetinsider.com on the Deutsche Bank upgrade:\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) from Hold to Buy with a price target of $310.00 (from $222.00). Analyst Rod Lache now sees a steeper growth trajectory, a richer mix, and lower costs.\n\"There were a number of disclosures made by the Tesla\u2019s Management on their 2Q14 earnings conference call which could be viewed as very significant not only for Tesla, but for the overall Auto Industry. In summary, Tesla suggested that their growth trajectory will be much steeper, their mix will be much richer, and their costs will ultimately be much lower than we previously assumed. We are revising our estimates to reflect updated assumptions for growth and profitability, and are raising our rating to Buy from Hold with a $310 target,\" said Lache.\n\"We are adjusting our 2015, 2016, and 2017 volume estimates to 60,000, 100,000, and 129,000 from 51,000, 60,000, and 83,000. And even these estimates may be conservative, given that Tesla expects to end 2014 and 2015 with 50,000 and 100,000 units of capacity. At this point we see an increasingly clear path to 500,000 units of annual production by late this decade. And we don\u2019t expect growth to end there, as Tesla is already contemplating opportunities for additional production capacity,\" he continued.\n\"Tesla suggested that their mix is likely to be much more richly skewed (Model S/X vs. Model 3) than we had been assuming. Moreover, Tesla is now explicitly targeting battery pack costs of $150/kWh by late 2017 (vs. <$250/kWh today). And they anticipate costs declining below $100/kWh within the next 10-years. Based on discussions with industry experts, we believe that improvements of this magnitude will likely require significant advancements in cathode, anode, and electrolyte technology. But they do not appear to be completely out of reach. We believe that achieving these costs could have profound implications not only for Tesla, but for the overall Auto Industry, as it would imply an outright cost advantage for Tesla\u2019s EV\u2019s vs. Internal Combustion competitors,\" he added.\n\nTesla up 3,5% in the pre market, you bears mad? Yeah, you mad.",
