The supervisor that i spoke to at the time said it happens occasionally and to contact them with tracking numbers and dates if it happened again.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s happened again twice since January and i&#39;ve called the same supervisor back each time. I got the same &#39;happens occasionally&#39; excuse from him in January but this time i had proof that nobody tried to deliver as our door buzzer is now connected to my cell. So no missed call = no delivery attempt. UPS manage to hit the buzzer and deliver but CP doesn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>His response today was that a lot of these mail folk are contractors and &quot;don&#39;t get paid to press a buzzer&quot;. He wasn&#39;t able to give me a rational explanation re part of the mail delivery process involves ringing a doorbell/buzzer so how do they fulfil their delivery aspect. He also mentioned that the current carrier is about 1 month from retirement and that may be part of the issue (i.e. person has checked out/doesn&#39;t care).</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: First world problem i know but Canada Post mailperson has been &quot;attempting delivery&quot; (but not really)for months.
