Photo: Associated Press*\n\nBy Carlos Tejada\n\nUpdated Jan. 28, 2015 6:58 p.m. ET\n\nBEIJING\u2014The Chinese government accused e-commerce giant Alibaba of failing to crack down on the sale of fake goods, bribery and other illegal activity on its sites in a rare public dispute with one of the country\u2019s most prominent companies.\n\nThe claims\u2014which prompted Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Wednesday to accuse a senior official at a government agency of misconduct and threaten to file a formal complaint\u2014highlight a major risk for the company that last year raised $25 billion from global investors in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering.\n\nAlibaba has long grappled with allegations that Taobao, its biggest e-commerce platform, is rife with counterfeit goods. The accusations from the Chinese government could lend further force to those complaints and damage Alibaba\u2019s reputation among investors and brands overseas, while the highly public spat could hurt the company\u2019s relationship with the government, experts warn.\n\nThe government\u2019s accusations are in a white paper made public on Wednesday by China\u2019s State Administration for Industry and Commerce, but based on conversations between the agency and Alibaba officials in July. That was two months before Alibaba\u2019s U.S. IPO, which valued the Chinese company at more than $230 billion. In the paper, the agency said it held off on disclosing details of the talk so as not to affect the IPO.\n\nThe paper alleged that Alibaba turned a blind eye to the sale of fake cigarettes, alcohol and branded handbags by vendors on its marketplace sites, as well as the sale of restricted weapons and other forbidden items.\n\nIt alleged that Alibaba staffers took bribes from merchants and others seeking help to boost their search rankings and to get advertising space. It also alleged that Alibaba ignored the practice by some vendors of faking transactions to make their sales volumes appear higher.\n\nThe paper also said company officials did nothing to stop merchants from using tactics such as false and misleading advertising. It accused Alibaba of alleged anticompetitive behavior such as forbidding merchants to participate in rival sites\u2019 promotions.\n\nThe report said the problems had grown to become Alibaba\u2019s \u201cgreatest credibility crisis\u201d since the company was established. Citing a Chinese phrase that refers to letting a small problem fester, the paper said, \u201cfor a long time, [Alibaba] didn\u2019t pay sufficient attention to the issue and didn\u2019t adopt effective measures, causing a neglected carbuncle to become the bane of its life.\u201d\n\nIn response, Alibaba\u2019s Taobao platform said it is \u201cwilling to assume the responsibility of fighting fakes\u201d and that its effort \u201cis far from complete.\u201d But it criticized the inspection methods of a top SAIC official, Liu Hongliang, and said it would file a formal complaint with the SAIC.\n\n\u201cWe believe director Liu Hongliang\u2019s procedural misconduct during the supervision process, irrational enforcement of the law and obtaining a biased conclusion using the wrong methodology has inflicted irreparable and serious damage to Taobao and Chinese online businesses,\u201d Taobao said in a statement.\n\nAn SAIC representative said the agency didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\n\nIMAGE *[that is, a strategically placed image of Jack Ma looking very worried]* : \n\nhttp://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BS615_ALIBAB_M_20150128172909.jpg  \n\n*Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma is shown in Davos, Switzerland, last week.

Photo: Bloomberg News*\n\nAlibaba also said it welcomed additional supervision, as well as greater efforts by law enforcement to crack down on fakes. Alibaba is a victim and not a beneficiary of counterfeit items, it said.\n\n\u201cWe understand the difficulties faced by the regulatory authority in regulating a fast-changing innovative environment, but we hope the authority can see the millions of young people\u201d taking risks, innovating and persevering as entrepreneurs, it said.\n\nAlibaba has said that it spends more than $16 million a year combating counterfeits on its marketplaces.\n\nThe criticism comes as China has put increasing emphasis on intellectual-property protection as it tries to foster innovation and move away from an economy dependent on cheap manufacturing and big government spending.\n\nLast year the Chinese government announced a campaign to address online infringement and counterfeiting that includes a significant focus on e-commerce.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that [the government has] concluded Alibaba isn\u2019t doing enough,\u201d said Joe Simone, a Hong Kong-based anticounterfeiting lawyer specializing in China, who called the government\u2019s open criticism \u201csort of unprecedented.\u201d\n\nAlibaba is widely considered to enjoy a healthy relationship with the government, despite initiatives like online payments that have challenged the traditional supremacy of China\u2019s stodgy state-owned banks. Speaking at the WSJD Live Conference in October, Alibaba founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma said, \u201cwe create 14 million jobs for China. We are making all the banks change. So the government finally realized that we\u2019re helping them.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether the SAIC\u2019s accusations would result in further action. In the white paper, it said the July meeting \u201cbasically achieved the anticipated outcome.\u201d It said SAIC officials would beef up their monitoring of Alibaba\u2019s practices and build a system to better supervise online transactions.\n\nPeter Luo, a portfolio manager at U.S. asset-management firm RS Investments, which bought Alibaba shares in the IPO last year, said the accusations were concerning. \u201cI think this dispute could pose a serious risk for Alibaba,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could damage not only Alibaba\u2019s relationship with the government and regulators, but also the perception among consumers. If consumers lose confidence in Alibaba, its business will be affected.\u201d\n\nIn its prospectus filed with U.S. regulators ahead of the IPO, Alibaba said it could face legal action or reputational damage from the sale of counterfeit goods on its platforms, even as it said it had taken steps to weed out those products. It doesn\u2019t mention the July discussions with the SAIC.\n\nIn terms of the timing of the talks two months before the IPO, Mr. Luo said, \u201cAs an investor, we prefer more disclosure and transparency, especially when it comes to important issues like regulation and relationships with the government. And in this case, the issue seems very relevant to Alibaba\u2019s core business.\u201d\n\nAlibaba representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the disclosure issue.\n\nSuch a vehement response to a regulator is rare in a country where the Communist party controls both the government and the courts, and where successful appeals of government decisions are rare.\n\n\u201cAlibaba\u2019s reaction is quite strong, and I would say somewhat unusual,\u201d said Paolo Beconcini, a Beijing-based managing partner at Carroll, Burdick & McDonough who specializes in intellectual-property issues. \u201cNormally, what you would do is negotiate with the government.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI can\u2019t say if Alibaba is responding to the [SAIC] report in the right way.\u201d\n\nThe flare-up between Alibaba and the SAIC follows a report on fakes released by the agency. The report, dated last week, said it found a number of counterfeit items on Taobao, particularly among mobile phones and toys.\n\nOn Tuesday, Taobao said on its official Weibo social-media account that the SAIC survey was based on a small sample size and contained other flaws. The post, which was unsigned, was later deleted.\n\nOn Tuesday, SAIC defended its findings, saying it has an obligation to monitor and protect the marketplace.\n\nThe agency has a broad role in marketplace regulation, including overseeing trademark and corporate records issues, and has a role enforcing China\u2019s antimonopoly law.\n\nTaobao was long included on the U.S. government\u2019s list of \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for common counterfeit goods. The U.S. removed Taobao from the list in late 2012, citing the efforts it had made to curb fakes. Still, some companies and others have since criticized Taobao and Alibaba\u2019s other platforms for not doing enough to stamp out counterfeit and gray market products.\n\nAlibaba doesn\u2019t sell products on Taobao itself. The marketplace offers a platform for outside sellers\u2014often mom-and-pop outfits\u2014to sell their products to Chinese consumers. It also offers its Tmall platform, which is home to online stores often dedicated to major global brands in cosmetics, electronics and other goods.\n\n\u2014 Olivia Geng in Beijing and Kathy Chu and Juro Osawa in Hong Kong contributed to this article.\n\n**TOP READER-RECOMMENDED COMMENT AND THE FOLLOWING THREAD:**\n\nChristine Bennett 19 hours ago\n\nThe mentality of the Chinese really does show through in the comment that the regulators held off on disclosure, as it might affect the IPO. It did affect the IPO...it transferred more value to the sellers than truly was there had this come out pre IPO.   Caveat Emptor when it comes to China \n\nNicole Hamilton 19 hours ago\n\n@Christine Bennett I was thinking the same thing.  It's why I have a standing order with my financial advisor:  I will not invest in China.  Period.  You have no way of knowing what you're getting.\n\nRobert Scheppy 18 hours ago\n\n@Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett \n\nYou can probably buy stock in Hong Kong and Singapore. Both places are pretty honest in my experience.\n\nNicole Hamilton 17 hours ago\n\n@Robert Scheppy @Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett \n\nLOL.  There are LOTS of places that are pretty honest.  China is about the only place I can think of where I've drawn a line and decided I won't invest there because I don't trust their accounting, their disclosures, their disrespect for IP, you name it, but it does add up to honesty.  I'm always happy to consider allocating part of my portfolio to pretty much anywhere else in the world -- and over the years, I probably have at different times.  But China, no way.\n\nRobert Scheppy 14 hours ago\n\n@Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett \n\nThose of us who have lived in China know that nothing is what it appears to be. Based on experience.\n\nFrank Pecarich 18 hours ago\n\n@Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett \n\nI hope you remember your comment as China is, and will continue to overtake and surpass the US in terms of the global economy as well as eventually replace their currency for the USD as the global reserve currency.  The US economy is on the downside of it's effective life and the China economy is on the upside.  Good luck a decade from now with those US equities vs  Asia's.\n\nNicole Hamilton 17 hours ago\n\n@Frank Pecarich @Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett \n\nThe entire rest of the world will always be an alternative to investing in China.\n\nFrank Pecarich 15 hours ago\n\n@Nicole Hamilton @Frank Pecarich @Christine Bennett \n\nThe entire rest of the world?  Are you investing in the EU countries?  If you are you are a fool.  How about South America?  Are you piling up shares in their equities or bonds?  No?\n\nNicole Hamilton 14 hours ago\n\n@Frank Pecarich @Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett \n\nMy only significant EU holding right now is BMW (BMW.XE), the auto company, which I bought last year.  I probably have some small additional percentage in Europe through various other holdings but right now, it would be just that:  pretty small.\n\nThe Germans are still insisting on crushing the European economy with their completely wrongheaded insistence on austerity.  After 6 years of spectacular failure, you'd think otherwise smart people would realize their economic models simply don't work.  The Keynesians were right.  You cannot cut government spending in a recession without making it worse.\n\nRight now, ours is really the only economy on the planet that's at all healthy.  And that's because we chose a far more stimulative response with the original stimulus package in 2009 and, with interest rates already near zero, by growing the money supply rapidly in response to falling velocity.\n\nRamesh Gandham 12 hours ago\n\n@Nicole Hamilton\n\nI have been burned once with an investment in Chinese company ADR on NYSE. The company was followed by analysts in the US. There was a lot of \"research\" that was available from these firms glorifying the business, growth YOY. Turned out that there was a lot of fraud in the numbers put out by the company. I haven't invested in Chinese firms since but haven't sworn them off yet.",

Both places are pretty honest in my experience.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole Hamilton 17 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Robert Scheppy @Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett </p>\n\n<p>LOL.  There are LOTS of places that are pretty honest.  China is about the only place I can think of where I&#39;ve drawn a line and decided I won&#39;t invest there because I don&#39;t trust their accounting, their disclosures, their disrespect for IP, you name it, but it does add up to honesty.  I&#39;m always happy to consider allocating part of my portfolio to pretty much anywhere else in the world -- and over the years, I probably have at different times.  But China, no way.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Scheppy 14 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett </p>\n\n<p>Those of us who have lived in China know that nothing is what it appears to be. Based on experience.</p>\n\n<p>Frank Pecarich 18 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett </p>\n\n<p>I hope you remember your comment as China is, and will continue to overtake and surpass the US in terms of the global economy as well as eventually replace their currency for the USD as the global reserve currency.  The US economy is on the downside of it&#39;s effective life and the China economy is on the upside.  Good luck a decade from now with those US equities vs  Asia&#39;s.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole Hamilton 17 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Frank Pecarich @Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett </p>\n\n<p>The entire rest of the world will always be an alternative to investing in China.</p>\n\n<p>Frank Pecarich 15 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Nicole Hamilton @Frank Pecarich @Christine Bennett </p>\n\n<p>The entire rest of the world?  Are you investing in the EU countries?  If you are you are a fool.  How about South America?  Are you piling up shares in their equities or bonds?  No?</p>\n\n<p>Nicole Hamilton 14 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Frank Pecarich @Nicole Hamilton @Christine Bennett </p>\n\n<p>My only significant EU holding right now is BMW (BMW.XE), the auto company, which I bought last year.  I probably have some small additional percentage in Europe through various other holdings but right now, it would be just that:  pretty small.</p>\n\n<p>The Germans are still insisting on crushing the European economy with their completely wrongheaded insistence on austerity.  After 6 years of spectacular failure, you&#39;d think otherwise smart people would realize their economic models simply don&#39;t work.  The Keynesians were right.  You cannot cut government spending in a recession without making it worse.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, ours is really the only economy on the planet that&#39;s at all healthy.  And that&#39;s because we chose a far more stimulative response with the original stimulus package in 2009 and, with interest rates already near zero, by growing the money supply rapidly in response to falling velocity.</p>\n\n<p>Ramesh Gandham 12 hours ago</p>\n\n<p>@Nicole Hamilton</p>\n\n<p>I have been burned once with an investment in Chinese company ADR on NYSE. The company was followed by analysts in the US. There was a lot of &quot;research&quot; that was available from these firms glorifying the business, growth YOY. Turned out that there was a lot of fraud in the numbers put out by the company. I haven&#39;t invested in Chinese firms since but haven&#39;t sworn them off yet.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
