One stuck with me, because it seemed a bit out there - he said that he and my uncle (his brother) had invented a spell called Contingency. I looked this up and (as many of you know) the spell was indeed real, so I just believed it on principle because I was probably 10 and didn&#39;t know any better. I&#39;ve recently brought it up again once or twice, though, thinking I got dad joked, and he&#39;s stuck by it,  repeating the story to whoever cares just as he told it to me. It goes something like this:</p>\n\n<p>Back in high school, my dad and my uncle had a D&amp;D group with a few of their friends (this was late 70s;  I&#39;m not super up on my D&amp;D knowledge, but that might be before 2E, even?). One guy who DMed fairly often had a bad habit of making traps that were sort of unreasonable (they were just high schoolers, after all); it&#39;d be something like &quot;the chest is trapped and a pit opens up below you.  Before you have time to react,  you fall to your death&quot;, that sort of thing. This annoyed everyone else a bit, but they liked the guy enough as a DM and as a person to leave it alone.</p>\n\n<p>At some point, a contest was created by whoever was producing D&amp;D material at the time, asking participants to submit a spell that they created. The grand prize was, among other things, that your spell would be included in future Player&#39;s Handbooks or whatever they had at the time. My dad and uncle created some proto-form of Contingency (with that name), figuring that it would allow them (and others) to deal with overpowered traps like their DM&#39;s; the specific example he gave me was setting it to activate Feather Fall if you fell into a pit.</p>\n\n<p>To his surprise, the spell actually won the contest. In addition to getting the spell in the books, they won a bunch of free stuff (books, dice, shit like that) and were invited to attend some convention in Wisconsin or something, which they couldn&#39;t, being from New York.</p>\n\n<p>Did anyone around here play D&amp;D back then, or know someone who does, who can verify whether or not this contest, convention, etc actually existed? Based on my dad/uncle&#39;s ages, I&#39;d place this story around 1978 or 1979, maybe a bit earlier or later. I&#39;ve been curious about this every so often for years. I&#39;ve googled around a bit, stuff like &quot;d&amp;d 1970s contest&quot;, &quot;d&amp;d contingency origin&quot;, etc. and turned up nothing, but considering when this happened the details could have been lost to time.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Dad claims he invented Contingency as a contest entry in the late 70s, ended up winning. Curious if this can be verified.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: Thanks to <a href=\"/u/Nerdcuse\">/u/Nerdcuse</a> and <a href=\"/u/ctimmins\">/u/ctimmins</a>, it&#39;s been verified to have been submitted under my uncle&#39;s name!
