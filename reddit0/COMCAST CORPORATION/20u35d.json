Government Affairs positions are the corporate version of cronyism, usually reserved for those that have voted favorably towards a corporation while in office.  Meaning, if Xavier ever made any votes against broadband expansion in CSJ, Comcast will be giving him a job in Government Affairs should he ever not become re-elected. \n\nAnother thing to point out here, Comcast has donated to several Political action committees.  If a PAC does campaigning on behalf of a candidate, it doesn't count towards the candidates campaign expenditures because it's an \"Independent Committee\" \n\nAnyways, just watch him closely /r/sanjose'rs.   I'll see who else on council I can dig up comcast connections.\n\n**Edit** Another Comcast connection.\n\nHere's a few pictures of some guys doing a speech at a podium that says, \"Comcast\" \n\nhttp://imgur.com/QF1Tfg9\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ntRLEiy\n\nIn the picture with 3 guys, one of them is Eddie Garcia, right hand man of George Shirakawa.
