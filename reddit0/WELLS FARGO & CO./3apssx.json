  "selftext": "My marital home was originally financed through a FHA loan which is currently serviced by Wells Fargo, co-signed by my parents. \n\nFollowing the divorce, my ex-wife agreed to take the home and refinance in her name. She came to me today stating that the only way to get me and my parents off the loan is to streamline the current loan through a company called loan depot through lending tree. Her income prohibits her from a refinance. Once on this new loan, we can be removed from the mortgage. \n\nShe has been paying the loan on time and i do not suspect anything fishy on her end. However I can't seem to find any resources on a comparable situation. ie is this company legit? should I tell her to buzz off and find someone to refinance with?\n\nAny advice that doesn't involve a retainer fee?\n",
