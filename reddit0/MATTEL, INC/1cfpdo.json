Is there a room which has annoying flickering lights? Is there a main area for smokers? Any cool stuff? Where's the good cafes? etc etc\n\nI've had units at Hawthorn myself, but I need to know some nitty gritty. Stuff you wouldn't otherwise find out on the Swinburne site.\n\nThanks for your help in advance. I'll let you know how this assignment goes.",
