I&#39;m gonna try and take you through it, step by step, and I&#39;ll try not to rush anything. Please don&#39;t look at me as a monster. I did what I did, and I&#39;m not proud of it...</p>\n\n<p>We had slept during the day, so we awaken at night time. The watch I have showed 23:16, but I&#39;m not sure if it runs properly. As we&#39;ve grown tired of eating canned food, we decided to take a slice of beef each. Even though I slightly over-cooked it, it tasted like a slice of heaven itself. We decide to leave the camp where it is, seeing it&#39;s very well hidden inside a forest, and go by foot. The motorcycle is too loud, and we want to save the fuel. We marked a small industrial area just outside Elektrozavodsk, and decided this is where we&#39;re gonna go. It was a really long walk, but we hoped it would pay off. We needed spare tires, some engine parts and more jerry cans. This looked like the place to get it. Any extra general supplies we found on the way would only be considered bonuses.</p>\n\n<p>We go by the shore, just hidden by the treeline. We were hoping we&#39;d find a boat, and after a good thirty minutes of walking we actually find a goddamn boat. It was quite small, white and, urh, stranded... We tried getting it back into the water, but it was of no use. The boat was useless, and the effort, time and calories spent on trying to move it was wasted. On the way down we looted some smaller towns, no problems on the way, really. Note to any survivors out there reading this; Walkers appear to be near blind at night due to the darkness. Travel by night if you can!</p>\n\n<p>Upon getting close to our target destination when we&#39;re crossing the road, we hear engine rumble. The actual sound of a working engine and screeching of tires on the road. It was a big, blue and noisy as hell BUS! I&#39;m thinking &quot;Holy shit, this can&#39;t be good. How did he get it? Is there any more of them?&quot;. The driver sees us, and in panic I take aim. I empty an entire clip through the front windscreen and side windscreen as he drives past us. Blood splattering out of the window, the bus slows down to a halt. I look around me quickly to see if there&#39;s more people around, and hurry over to the bus.</p>\n\n<p>The guy had a weapon labeled &#39;M16A2&#39;, and it kind of looked like the same weapon I use. The ammunition he had in it seemed to fit mine, so I grabbed all three. He had raw beef, some canisters with water, Pepsi and a frag grenade. Emily take the beef and water, I grab the Pepsi and frag. As I straighten up and we&#39;re about to get the hell out of there, I see a person approaching from a tree, prone to not raise attention. Right now my head is exploding due to extreme stress and panic. How many saw the bus? How many heard it? How many people tracked in and for how long? HOW MANY ARE COMING TO GET IT?!</p>\n\n<p>I engage the guy by peaking to the right of the bus, and pop five shots in his head. He didn&#39;t see it coming. I see another guy on the shore, running like crazy towards us. He&#39;s shooting, bullets are flying, and both me and Emily take cover behind the bus. I flip around on the left, and drop the guy with all the bullets left in my magazine. Scared to hell, we quickly search the bus itself for valuables, supplies or anything worthwhile. Again we&#39;re being shot at! Where the hell is it coming from? Emily hits the floor inside the bus for cover, and I peak through the window to see if I can spot whoever that&#39;s shooting at us. Nothing. Next window.. Nope. No one here. More shooting, and a window breaks. We&#39;re not hit, only god knows how the hell  we&#39;re not dead yet. Now I see him! He&#39;s farther up the road, slightly covered by a tree. I get out the backdoor of the bus, drop to the ground and shoot him in the legs from under the bus.</p>\n\n<p>They appear to have broken straight off, and he&#39;s bleeding. A lot. It was quite sickening, and I felt horrible for doing it. The bus couldn&#39;t be worth these many lives? In pure instinct I get back up on my feet, and scuffle to the right. I take aim, and end his life. Right now I&#39;m feeling quite sick. I want to get out of here, forget it all and just go on living. That&#39;s when we hear it. Calls for help behind us, from the industrial area. We see a guy running towards us, unarmed, getting chased by three Walkers, or now Runners or what the hell you want to call it. I decide that there&#39;s no use nor honor in killing an unarmed man. I take aim, I hear him scream &quot;No! Don&#39;t shoot!!&quot;. I double tap my trigger, and see one of the Walkers drop. I shoot again, but barely miss. I get another one, and as the guy passes us I just manage to end the third.</p>\n\n<p>The guy drops to his knees, utterly exhausted. Between gaps we can hear him both thanking us and telling us to not shoot him. Obviously, we&#39;re not.  And we didn&#39;t. I give him some water and even the gun the guy driving the bus had, seeing it&#39;s out of ammunition. I ask Emily if we should take the bus, seeing our motorcycle only holds two people. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;No, you saw what happened. Everyone can see and hear it&quot;, she says, wise as ever.</p>\n\n<p>I tell the Emily and the unknown to get back as I throw a grenade under the engine of the bus.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;RUN YOU FOOLS!&quot;, I yell as the frag is cooking under the bus.</p>\n\n<p>With a thundering, brain-shaking boom, the bus disappears in a cloud of flames and smoke. I grab Emily&#39;s arm, tell the unknown to get on his feet, and we run into the woods.</p>\n\n<p>And now, here we are. We made a temporary camp far into the woods, though without a tent. The guy we saved is named Christian, and hes quite alright. I don&#39;t know how long he&#39;ll stick with us, but until then we&#39;re a party of three. This day will be forever seared into my brain. Both the good, and the bad. Hopefully there won&#39;t be anymore killing, though that&#39;s a fool&#39;s wish.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re still alive. Let&#39;s keep it that way.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>Signed,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Scrax</em></p>\n\n<p><em>23.07.2012</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cp.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/wwq4u/the_dayz_couple_on_the_road_again/\">&lt;--- Turn page</a> - Turn page ---&gt;</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/204/f/3/the_dayz_couple__reddit_journal_image_by_scraxlol-d58ctq2.png\">Screenshot of the three of us running together to survive</a></strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
