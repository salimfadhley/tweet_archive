  "selftext": "Hey everyone. :) Before the goods of the match, I would like to say a few words. The past two years have been the absolute best of my life. I've had the honor and privilege of casting every single IPL event since IPL1 (remember our introductory promo? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPaGzCHkmjk). Tonight, we see the conclusion of the last IPL event, our IPTL finals between LG-IM and MVP.\n\nTo appear on camera nearly every single day and bring awesome SC2 matches before you has been nothing short of a dream. The incredible team that I've worked with at the IGN ProLeague, from our casters, to the management, to our incredible production team, to our engineers, operations, and sales, everyone has been passionate about eSports and always strove to bring you guys the highest quality programming possible.\n\nMost importantly, though, were you the fans. You gave us the opportunity to bring this sort of content to you by tuning in, showing up to our events, and sharing every piece of content we created. We cannot thank you enough.\n\nI know there's been a lot of speculation as to the future of the IPL, and trust me, you'll all know more very soon. There's a deal almost in place that will see more awesome content from this team than you could ever imagine. I wish we could have announced it by now, but you'll know more soon, I promise. :D\n\nIn any case, thank you for being here for us for the past two years, thank you for attending our events, and thank you for tuning in night after night. We couldn't have done it without you.\n\nWithout further ado, here is your matchup for the final IPL event, LG-IM vs MVP.\n\nThe cast will be a tri-cast between myself, Tim \"Robin\" Frazier, and Andrew \"Kibbelz\" Dunne. We go live at 4:00 pm Pacific (6 hours from this post) on http://ign.com/ipl/starcraft-2 and http://twitch.tv/ignproleague -- The match is LG-IM vs MVP, and will be played in Heart of the Swarm with the winner receiving $9,000 for their efforts.\n\nThis may be the end of the IPL broadcasts, but I promise you'll hear more from us soon. Stay tuned. :D",
