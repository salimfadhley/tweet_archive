What is your position on this? \n  * In terms of the PS4 Lineup for the foreseeable future (the next year or two), what role do you think Indie games will play in the IGC?\n\n____________________\n\n**Statistics for This Month's Games**\n\n*Putting these here as a resource for discussion, and an easy way to compare the selection. I am not skilled at converting to Euros, and the EU PS Store would not load for me as a lowly American. Some numbers may be slightly off.
