  "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nEvery now and then I do stock screens to see if there are any companies that would be a good value investment.  Thanks to the bull market, the opportunities have been few and far between over the last year or two.  However one company has consistently popped up in my screens.  I initially ignored it as the company is in a sector I personally don't like to invest in due to the large capital requirements.  The company is Toyota Motors (TM). \n\n\nSimply put, the valuation seems too good to be true.\n\n\nFirst off, let me show you what I am talking about.  Here are the heat maps from FinViz:\n\n* [P/E](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_pe_large1600.png)\n* [Forward P/E](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_fpe_large1600.png)\n* [P/E/G](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_peg_large1600.png)\n* [P/BV](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_pb_large1600.png)\n\nNow as you can see, the general trend of the market is giving you discounts to Financials, Utilities, and Basic Materials, more specifically oil and gold.\n\nOf those sectors, I really only like Financials as big oil has been in a downward trend over the past three years.  Both Exxon and Chevron have produced less oil than the previous years and are both spending at near record high CapEx levels with no turnaround yet. I have continuously looked at both of them as I don't have any oil in my current portfolio, but haven't got myself to buy either of them.  \n\nFinancials will continue to be attractive at these levels as investors still don't trust their book values since the financial crisis even though asset quality has continued to improve on a broad base. Over the next 5 years, interest rates will rise which will increase their spread which in turn increases their profitability.\n\nFor the most part, it appears healthcare, consumer goods, and services are currently overvalued.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, let's look at Toyota.  Below is a quick multiples valuation against TM's peers.  These are from Yahoo! Finance as GM isn't on FinViz for some reason.\n\nP/E\n\n* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **7.81**\n* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 10.87\n* General Motors Co. (GM): 15.11\n* Ford Motor Co. (F): 8.65\n\nForward P/E\n\n* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **9.11**\n* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 9.30\n* General Motors Co. (GM): 7.35\n* Ford Motor Co. (F): 7.90\n\nP/E/G\n\n* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **0.29(!)**\n* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 0.37\n* General Motors Co. (GM): 0.52 \n* Ford Motor Co. (F): 0.97\n\nP/BV\n\n* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **1.02**\n* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 0.91\n* General Motors Co. (GM): 1.34\n* Ford Motor Co. (F): 2.91\n\nAs you can see, the whole sector looks cheap on a multiples basis, but of that bunch Toyota seems to win out on an overall valuation based on multiples.  \n\n*Per my own investing rules, as I am a long term shareholder, I won't touch a company that has recently been bankrupt, therefore I rule out GM for any potential investments.*\n\nNow Toyota is too big of a company to do a full report on in a couple of days.  However, of what little research I have done, this is what I have found.\n\nFirst of all, on a macro perspective, the yen has weakened against both the US Dollar and the Chinese Yuan. Over the past two years, the Dollar and Yuan have both gained over 30% to the yen and over 10% this past year.  This is a great thing for a Japanese multinational as North America and Asia is TM's second and third largest markets which combined are 46% of 2013's sales.  \n\n* [USD/JPY](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=USDJPY%3DX+Interactive#symbol=;range=2y;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=;)\n* [CNY/JPY](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=CNYJPY%3DX+Interactive#symbol=CNYJPY=X;range=2y)\n\nBecause of this, profitability should be higher within Toyota which is also a reason to buy them over GM or Ford as the american automakers will lose money with a strong dollar overseas.\n\nOver the past three years, TM has a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.12%.  Last year, North America saw 32.8% sales growth and Asia saw 30.22% sales growth.  This compounded with the yen weakening is a one-two punch.\n\nDue to the strong demand in both North America and Asia, Toyota has had a surge in Consolidated Net Income for Fiscal Year 2014 of 135% in which ForEx is responsible for 123% of that growth alone. In this latest quarter, Net Revenues are up 23.9% with Net Income up 118%. \n\n[Toyota's Shareholder Presentation](http://www.toyota-global.com/investors/financial_result/2014/pdf/q3/presentation.pdf)\n\nMargins have increased across the board with their Gross Profit increasing from last year:\n\nTM's Gross Profit Margin\n\n* 2013: 15.51%\n* 2012: 11.81%\n* 2011: 12.52%\n\nAs for a quick look at the balance sheet, Toyota has been de-leveraging over the past 5 years with Total Debt / Equity of 1.25 in 2009 to 1.16 in 2013.  Book Value per Share has stayed relatively flat but grew 15.14% from 2012 to 2013.   Compare that to a one year increase in share price of only 12.25% I believe we have a winner.\n\nThis is only what I have found off of a couple hours looking at this tonight and have only scratched the surface as to the information on this company.\n\nHowever after just a small amount of research I firmly believe this is a truly undervalued company and should be bought right away.\n\nReferences:\n[Quick Stats pulled from TM's Annual Report](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8DDDE01AC2383407!2625&authkey=!AOcem9NVPa1KxXA&ithint=file%2c.xlsx)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**EDIT** Thank you all for the replies.  I should state that this is just beginning due diligence and there are several assumptions with this thesis, mainly that the Yen will stay depressed at least over the next year.  This type of condition is a **short term catalyst** only and not a long term theme.  As some have mentioned already, FX has been almost entirely behind TM's profit and there are real geopolitical risks between Japan and China.\n\nNext week I will put together another post looking more into the actual underlying company's long term performance and management's strategic plan going forward.  That way we can get a glimpse of what the company might look like in the future.\n\nAgain thank you all for the kind words and the intelligent discussion around this topic.  ",
