They took a vacation to the Dominican Republic and, rather than pay the daily parking fees at LAX, asked if my wife and I could just take the car till they get back. Initially I hated it, with all its gadgets and stuff. After driving it for a few days (and my father-in-law telling me about sport mode) I think I have fallen in love.</p>\n\n<p>After the initial pink cloud of love, I started to think about the cost of ownership and what not, and I realized I have no idea about the costs related to luxury vehicles. I haven&#39;t owned a luxury vehicle before and my friends that have own them for the name, not for the performance.</p>\n\n<p>So my question to you all is this: besides gas and the car payment, what can I expect as a BMW owner? I&#39;ve heard everything from they don&#39;t last past 100k miles to they cost thousands to repair and so on. I would like to hear from actual BMW nerds exactly what to expect.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you guys</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
