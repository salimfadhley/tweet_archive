  "selftext": "Update: **Camp Quest Inc. has issued an official statement. Read it [here](http://www.campquest.org/oklahomajoes).** \n\n[Picture summarizing the situation](http://i.imgur.com/CZnjpoi)! \n\nCamp Quest Oklahoma organized a fundraiser dinner at a local BBQ chain, Oklahoma Joe's BBQ. They planned and advertised the event for weeks. Once the group and their supporters were there buying food, the group was forced to leave due to their affiliation with a secular/atheist group. \n\nFrom the camp director: \n\n> For those who had planned to come out tonight and support Camp Quest we thank you. We hope you spread the word about what happened. This isn't just about us being discriminated against, but our campers being punished for it. So I hope you consider donating directly to us. This is why we have Camp Quest, this is so our campers can attend a camp and have a week where they won't have to fear about being different or discriminated against for being themselves. \n\nSupport Camp Quest's work! Donations support camperships (which offset the cost for families with financial need), buy telescopes, etc. All staff are volunteers. \n\n* http://campquestoklahoma.org/donate/\n* http://www.campquest.org/donate/ \n\n\nEdit: Camp Quest is the summer camp for secular families. I can't describe it any better than what's on the [about Camp Quest](http://www.campquest.org/about) page. \n\n>Camp Quest provides an educational adventure shaped by fun, friends and freethought, featuring science, natural wonder and humanist values. \n>Values we teach: integrity, empathy, creativity, critical thinking, and community. \n>Camp Quest envisions a world in which children grow up exploring, thinking for themselves, connecting with their communities, and acting to make the most of life for themselves and others. \n\nEdit 2: According to the restaurant \n>They were not asked to leave. Oklahoma Joe's Regrets that the facilitators of the event did not fully disclose their beliefs. These beliefs do not align with the christian philosophy of our organization and we cannot financially contribute to their cause. We will provide service to anyone. Joe Davidson. \n\nBut really, CQOK made flyers explaining Camp Quest and its mission, which presumably the restaurant approved beforehand since it was the \"ticket\" to the fundraiser. \n\nEdit 3: **Thanks to everyone who has done the legwork on figuring out what really happened. See [davemuscato's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1by9y0/camp_quest_oklahoma_was_just_kicked_out_of_their/c9b94bl) below.** If you are angry, disappointed, etc. consider donating a few dollars to Camp Quest. That was the goal of the fundraiser tonight - to raise money to send kids to camp. \n\nEdit 4: See the post at [The Friendly Atheist](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/04/08/camp-quest-oklahoma-planned-a-fundraiser-at-a-local-restaurant-tonight-but-the-christian-owner-is-refusing-to-work-with-them/) for more, including a **[first-person account by a CQOK supporter](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/04/08/camp-quest-oklahoma-planned-a-fundraiser-at-a-local-restaurant-tonight-but-the-christian-owner-is-refusing-to-work-with-them/#comment-856947747)**. \n\nEdit 5: Some more information and perspective from [What Would JT Do](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wwjtd/2013/04/camp-quest-oklahoma-kicked-out-of-their-own-fundraiser-by-christian-business-owner/). \n\nEdit 6: The [Stiefel Freethought Foundation](http://www.stiefelfreethoughtfoundation.org/) will be matching all donations to CQOK! This means your $5 donation becomes $10! From Camp Quest Inc's Facebook page: \n\n> The Stiefel Freethought Foundation will be matching donations made to Camp Quest Oklahoma for the next week in response to the fundraiser cancellation! For every dollar you give to CQ OK, The Stiefel Freethought Foundation will give a dollar to Camp Quest national up to $5000! Donate at www.campquestoklahoma.org/donate \n\nEach Oklahoma Joe's BBQ is a separate entity from the one in Broken Arrow, OK that is the subject of this post. The branch in Kansas City KS issued such a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151420453457637&id=120089257636) today. \n\nThe local [FOX news ran a story](http://www.fox23.com/news/local/story/Broken-Arrow-business-says-faith-gets-in-the-way/vAcwMQrIzUCFekpYFVA8xA.cspx) called \"Broken Arrow business says faith gets in the way of charity work.\" \n\n/u/campquest posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1by9y0/camp_quest_oklahoma_was_just_kicked_out_of_their/c9bnocl) about the community's response :) \n\nEdit 7: **[Official post from Camp Quest Inc.](http://www.campquest.org/oklahomamatch)** (the national headquarters) about all this. \n\nCamp Quest Oklahoma's Kickstarter project has been fully funded - campers will be building rockets and making modern art. From the CQOK Facebook page: \n> Camp Quest Oklahoma's and Jackalope Joe's Kickstarter project has been fully funded! Thank you all for your love and support! The kids will launch rockets and fling paint in your honor! Plus with the Stiefel Foundation matching this fundraiser you have help support the creation of new camps. So once again Thank You! http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1029846501/art-4-youth-project-art-that-shoots-for-the-stars \n\nReddit has once again come through to support the freethought/atheist community, as well as kids in need of a safe place to explore their identity. Thanks to this incident, hundreds of people (thousands?!) have learned about Camp Quest and the work they do all over the country. Thanks to everyone who shared, donated, and/or upvoted! Registration is still open for most of the summer camps for 2013, and many of the camps need additional adult volunteers. \n\nEdit 8: Local [Tulsa ABC news story](http://www.ktul.com/story/21923320/broken-arrow-restaurant-stops-kid-camp-fundraiser-with-conflicting-beliefs) called \"Broken Arrow Restaurant Stops Kid Camp Fundraiser With Conflicting Beliefs.\" \n\nEdit 9: Local [NBC news story](http://www.kjrh.com/dpp/news/local_news/broken_arrow/camp-quest-oklahoma-claims-oklahoma-joes-owner-booted-kids-camp-fundraiser-from-restaurant), \"Camp Quest Oklahoma claims Oklahoma Joe's owner booted kids camp fundraiser from restaurant.\" This article contains a link to an official [statement from Oklahoma Joe's BBQ](http://media2.kjrh.com/html/pdfs/okjoes_statement.pdf) (pdf). The statement says that \"Camp Quest is intended to foster non-religious beliefs in children.\" This is simply not true, as described on the [Camp Quest FAQs](http://www.campquest.org/about). \n\nLess than 48 hours after the incident at the restaurant, Camp Quest Oklahoma is about $100 from meeting the $5k match challenge from the Stiefel Freethought Foundation! From CQ OK's Facebook: \n\n> We have 23 requests for financial aid. Every dollar counts. These kids need a secular science camp experience. LET'S DO THIS! \n\nAll [15 Camp Quest locations](http://www.campquest.org/locations) are in the same boat, with a huge demand for financial assistance. The Helen Kagin Memorial Campership Fund, in honor of one of the founders of Camp Quest, supports camperships at all 15 locations: \n\n* http://www.campquest.org/kaginfund \n\nEdit 10: A [protest has officially been called off](https://www.facebook.com/notes/american-atheists-inc-official/atheists-call-off-protest-of-oklahoma-joes-barbecue/10151566169501346) by American Atheists Inc. \n\nEdit 11: **Camp Quest Oklahoma is having a [BBQ and fishing event](https://www.facebook.com/events/163222117171137/) on April 27th.** B&B Bait Shop N-More in Henryetta, OK is hosting, and donating 20% of profits from food to Camp Quest. \n\nEdit 12: **Camp Quest Inc. has issued an official statement. Read it [here](http://www.campquest.org/oklahomajoes).**\n\nEdit 13: A [support page for Oklahoma Joe's BBQ](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Support-Oklahoma-Joes-Broken-Arrow-OK-Weekend/517967071583122) has been created on Facebook: \n> With all the stories about Oklahoma Joe's BBQ in Oklahoma we wanted to help support a great Christian Business. So this weekend lets show them how much we appreciate their BBQ. This page is not created by anyone from or affiliated with the company. This has been created by those individuals that believe in free speech and an owner of a company can do as he so decides with his own company.\n\nLate on April 10th, almost all of the ~200 posts were against OK Joe's. All of those have now been deleted (no, I didn't get a screenshot), as indicated by posts by OK Joe's supporters that are arguing against a non-existent post. (Thanks to /u/firebirddp for this news.) \n\nEdit 14: An [open group for discussing the OK Joe's situation](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BoycottOKjoesBA/) has been created on Facebook. Unlike the last group, this one will *not* delete comments from one perspective. Everyone can join, voice their opinions, and work to better understand others' points of view. (Thanks again /u/firebirddp!) ",
