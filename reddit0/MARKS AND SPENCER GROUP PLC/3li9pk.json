One of these edited files was experimental changes to the M4A1-S, which overwrote the vanilla files for the M4A1-S and gave me the results that I presented in my now deleted post on the topic.  My previous threads on the M4A1-S nerf not being in effect are correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  Thought I&#39;d explain what exactly has been causing all this confusion about the nerf and if it was or wasn&#39;t applied each update.  Basically, the weapon variable that controls armor penetration for the M4A1-S is buggy.  M4A1-S, USP-S, and CZ75-Auto all work by taking an existing weapon file and overwriting certain weapon values to create a new gun.  The M4A1-S uses the M4A4&#39;s file (weapon_m4a1.txt) the USP-S uses the P2000&#39;s file (weapon_hkp2000.txt) and the CZ75-Auto uses the P250&#39;s file (weapon_p250.txt).  While it&#39;s usually very easy for me to find out what&#39;s changed in an update at a glance, these three weapons have always caused trouble due to how they are implemented.  During the release of the M4A1-S and USP-S several variables (InaccuracyFireAlt and RangeModifier) were broken and defaulted to the value used by their parent file.  While Valve has fixed the majority of these issues, armor penetration still remains bugged due to the fact that none of these guns had an armor penetration value that differed from the file they were overwriting, so it went unnoticed.</p>\n\n<p>As of right now, the armor penetration is 62.5% according to the in game files, but due to the fact that it isn&#39;t functioning, it still uses the M4A4&#39;s value of 70%.  Because there is no way for me to see if the variable has been fixed, I have to test it empirically in game which can of course lead to some misleading results.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
