Happy new year to everyone!\n\nBeen through some terrible experience at Team Liquid Store and thought it might be useful for some of you that are planning to buy there.\n\n1. Around mid September, the Windranger T-shirt with Rainmaker code was restocked on TL store. Some friends and I figured that we would like to buy some and share the shipping cost since Valve Store doesn't deliver to my country. So I placed an order for 5 T-shirts at $30/each. That's a subtotal of $150 plus $19.75 shipping cost.\n2. On 17 Sep, I received an email from TL store that my order has been shipped. But according to [USPS tracking](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=LN151272615US) it's stuck in Chicago since the second day.\n3. On 26 Oct, still haven't received my order yet and unable to track, I sent the first email to TL support and they said it'd take up to 8 weeks to arrive.\n4. On 18 Nov, which is about 9 weeks after delivery, I sent yet another to their support and was promised a refund.\n5. But... I never received the refund and they haven't replied to my email asking for status for more than 2 weeks. (And my friend hasn't paid me either)\n\nI had been a fan of TL since pre-TI3 days, but things like this just make me advise everyone not to shop at TL Store. I would take Steam Support over this at any time.\n\n* [Link to email screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/bKbj2)\n* [Link to PayPal transaction](http://i.imgur.com/h2rMdwK.png)\n* [Link to PayPal's response to their closing my dispute](http://i.imgur.com/lar212T.png)\n\nTL;DR: I spent ~$170 at Team Liquid Store. Have never received the items, was promised a refund, but no longer hearing from their support any more.",
