Apparently someone from corporate emailed them the link to my reddit post and so they weren't to happy with me about that. I told them i didn't mention their dealership I only mentioned it was in california so however they found out is not my doing, plus i was very upset. They told me I should've contacted them before posting anything to give them a chance to do something. I told them you already told me you couldn't do anything. She said you still signed the papers, i told her you didnt leave me much choice. Either go home without a car, order another one wait 4 months and end up paying more, or take the car. Now they are telling me i can drive it and trade it in when my manual one comes, but they cant put the $1000 toward the car and they cant tell me how much ill be paying. I told her to take the $1000 off the sticker price, I was told they cant. I told her why would i take a gamble and order another car from them without knowing how much ill be paying. She told me its a nice car, to drive it and enjoy it and she would talk to her manager to see what they could do. I was told that they couldn't do anything since it was already processed.\n\nfast forward till now, manager says they cant do anything. I'm more upset at how they handled things afterwards then the car not being manual. I gave them a chance to take the car back the very next day when it had less then 70 miles on it, they said they cant, which i know they can, they just don't want to.  I had to constantly contact them I was never reached out to nor apologized to. So for now I'm just going to make sure no one i know does business with them, including me.\n\n\nsince it's out there already. it's BMW of Monrovia\n\n****NEW UPDATE POST HERE****\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/2oce5g/update_3_bmw_m235i_came_in_automatic_ordered/\n\n***UPDATE 12/5/2014***\n\nDaniel just called me and said I can come in tomorrow to return the car and he will order a new one for me and provide me with a loaner. I was beginning to think this was a waste of time this is such a relief. It took a month but still it's finally getting settled, i honestly would've just accepted it if it wasn't for you guys. Thank you.\n\n***UPDATE 12/6/2014***\n\nso I went there to get everything settled. she definitely was not happy with me, told me \"I was messed up for what i did bashing them like that\". so i never did get an apology, which was disappointing, tried to make me out to be the bad guy, but it is what it is. Everything else got handled, got a 328i as a loaner, ordered new one M235i manual, she printed it out and had me sign it, not sure if that's the policy now or it was done to patronize me, either way much smarter of them. they took the car back. their going to check the car for damage on Monday, part of me feels like they might try to tell me i damaged the car to get back at me. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.",
