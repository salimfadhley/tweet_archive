Each tank has its own pump which can be controlled with a pc that was wonderware software installed in it. We have just one pump that refuses to cooperate. When I go to the MCC and put it on remote, the computer fails to recognize it as remote and its status stays in 'local'. We replaced the MCC bucket but we are still having the same issue. All other pumps respond except that one. We replaced the on\\off switch on it as well but no luck. We wont get an electrical instrumentation guy in until next week and we really need this pump running, so as a last ditch measure of desperation I am wondering if anyone here can shed some light on the situation. Any help is appreciated.",
