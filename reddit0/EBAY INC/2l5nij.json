The price is competitive with similar items, people are viewing and watching them, but I never seem to have anyone bid on anything. Even at half the value of the items, I have no takers. What I do get though, is dozens of emails asking me if they can take them for stupidly low prices outside of Ebay, like \u00a310 for a high end smartphone inc. P&P.\n\nWhat the hell is happening? Is Ebay just a no-go area for normal people wanting to get rid of their old things now? Or is there something else I\u2019m missing?",
