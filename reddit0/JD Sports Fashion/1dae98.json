  "selftext": "Hey all! You might remember the post I made a few months ago about the [History of the Hardy Boyz](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/18lo0m/the_history_of_matt_and_jeff_hardy/) (cheap plug bang bang). I\u2019m here today to take a look back at JBL\u2019s reign as the WWE Champion. This was the main storyline for the better part of a year on Smackdown(!), spanning from the breakup of the APA in mid 2004, up until Wrestlemania 21. The Wrestling God was a smart man, enlisting the help of Orlando Jordan to be his \u201cChief of Staff\u201d and The Basham Brothers to be his \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d.\n\nBradshaw and Faarooq were the APA, together since  the late 90s. You may remember these guys as the beer chugging, ass kicking, tough-as-nails wrestlers who also liked to have some [fun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1wC5l58480). As time went on, however, Bradshaw felt it was time to move on, that maybe he was being held back by his tag team partner. It all came to a head when APA lost to 2 Cool (yes, fuckin\u2019 Scotty 2 Hotty) and Ron Simmons was fired. From that, JBL was [born]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6XI63A35gA&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI&index=1)\n\nQuickly establishing himself as a tycoon/millionaire/republican heel character, he set his sights on not just the WWE champion Eddie Guerrero, however all Mexican Immigrants who happened to live [(or tried to live)]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x119jd_jbl-kicks-out-illegals_news#.UX1lk6VSXgQ) in the USA. Things then got [personal]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi3rbzwGMX0&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI) after Eddie brought in his family during a house show. I still get goosebumps every time I watch that one. They were finally set to meet.\n\n**Judgment Day 2004** Eddie Guerrero vs JBL \u2013 [Singles match](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xx2kij_eddie-guerrero-vs-jbl-judgment-day-2004_sport#.UX1nTqVSXgQ) \n\nFollowing this match, it seemed that Eddie was starting to get the [upper hand](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xulrdi_eddie-guerrero-remodels-jbl-s-limo-09-12-04_shortfilms#.UX1oCaVSXgQ) on JBL. The rematch was inevitable, with JBL looking to capture his first ever WWE title. \n\n**The Great American Bash 2004** Eddie Guerrero vs JBL \u2013 [Texas Bullrope Match]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QKF3r4aC4)\n\nJBL had done it, he has finally won the big one, even if it was in a controversial fashion (you\u2019ll start seeing the pattern soon enough) He was ready to defend his title at Summerslam that year, however [this]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kMqI51qeGQ&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI) he was most definitely NOT ready for. Despite this, JBL seemingly still decided to take Undertaker [lightly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPZnYVqnTCo&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI). \u201cHell, I hate short people!\u201d Oh Bradshaw, you slay me.\n\n**Summerslam 2004** JBL vs The Undertaker \u2013 [Singles Match]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZzrO2z_XNg&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI) [Part 2]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QS6wgixY-M&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI)\n\nBarely making it out alive, JBL had quite the [injury]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwrov6d-M7E&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI), although that didn\u2019t stop him from trying to get the leg up on Taker. He tried bringing back a few faces (or heels, yuk yuk) from the deadman\u2019s past, forcing him into a [2 on 1 handicap match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2zmt0_the-undertaker-vs-gangrel-and-visce_news#.UX1rLaVSXgQ). Undertaker made quick work of Viscera and Gangrel, as well as [OJ]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xk5a20_wwe-smackdown-undertaker-sacrifices-orlando-jordan-2004_sport#.UX1sAqVSXgQ), so JBL was next.\n\n**No Mercy 2004** JBL vs The Undertaker \u2013 [Last Ride Match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5tejz_jbl-vs-undertaker-1-2_people#.UX1svqVSXgQ) [Part 2]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5tfau_jbl-vs-undertaker-2-2_people#.UX1s5KVSXgQ)\n\nJohn Bradshaw Layfield managed to knock off The Undertaker twice, even if it was with a little help here and there. Next in line to face the champ was Booker T. Booker T was drafted to Smackdown in early 2004, and was doing alright on the blue brand. GM Teddy Long told Booker to step it up, and he has the chance to do so in a TAG TEAM MATCH PLAYA. I\u2019m not sure the circumstance of Booker\u2019s parter, but it is fun to [watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih_i0MYxlZk&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI&index=15) nonetheless. I love how, with no context, it really seemed like booker didn\u2019t have any friends backstage. No one wanted to team up with the number one contender? How about Funaki for Christs sake? Mordecai? Kizarny? Palmer Cannon?! \n\n**Survivor Series 2004** JBL vs Booker T - [Singles match]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6hjYjS_g2w&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI)\n\nHaving beaten Booker T, Undertaker and Eddie Guerrero in recent months, each of these men had a personal vendetta against JBL. It was announced there would be a fatal four way for the title at Armageddon. Bradshaw and company had their chance to weaken the other participants on an episode on Smackdown in a [4 on 3 handicap match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7ku18_eddie-booker-t-undertaker-vs-cabine_sport#.UX1wkKVSXgQ).\n\n**Armageddon 2004** JBL vs The Undertaker vs Booker T vs Eddie Guerrero \u2013 [Fatal Four-way match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7q4kg_the-undertaker-vs-booker-t-vs-eddie_sport#.UX1xSqVSXgQ) [Part 2]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7q4z1_the-undertaker-vs-booker-t-vs-eddie_sport#.UX1xZaVSXgQ)\n\nOh that [Heidenreich]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3xlqh_heidenreich-heidenrapes-michael-col_news?search_algo=2#.UX1xs6VSXgQ). With Royal Rumble season upon us, Booker and Eddie decided to try their luck in the Royal Rumble match, while Undertaker was preoccupied with Heidenreich in a [casket match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xy3vfs_the-undertaker-vs-heidenreich_sport#.UX1zCaVSXgQ). Sorry. JBL was in need of a new challenger (or two) and came about them when the [Big Show/Kurt Angle feud]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmetc_big-show-throws-kurt-angle-from-bal_sport#.UX1zYaVSXgQ) found its way to the WWE title picture. Before the Rumble, JBL took on Kurt Angle in a [Last]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78Gke-IhaU) [Man]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX7Qe4bCDRg) [Standing]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtfgmVCglb4) match. A definite forgotten gem!\n\n**Royal Rumble 2005** JBL vs Kurt Angle vs Big Show \u2013 [Triple Threat match]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWYJa2IFxh8&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI) [Part 2]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgQgcZ1gW9o&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI)\n\nThe wrestling god just kept finding ways to survive with his title intact. His next challenge wouldn\u2019t prove to be so easy, against Show but in a new match, a steel cage with barbed wire around the top. They should have just called it the \u201calmost-hell-in-a-cell-but-not-really-because-we\u2019re-saving-that-for-Hunter-and-Dave\u201d match. JBL needed any upper hand he could get on Show, even if he had to make a [fool]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8hWJ1zbxs&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI) of himself in the process.\n\n**No Way Out 2005** JBL vs Big Show \u2013 [Barbed-Wire Steel Cage match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xy3pru_jbl-vs-big-show-barbed-wire-steel-cage_sport#.UX11zaVSXgQ)\n\nJBL decided he shouldn\u2019t be the only cabinet member with some gold around his waist, as Orlando Jordan got a shot at John Cena\u2019s [US title](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xay7t0_john-cena-vs-orlando-jordan-u-s-tit_sport#.UX12daVSXgQ) (sorry for the shit quality! Skip to the last minute or so and try to make out what the fuck happened!) He then sent a message to the new number one contender (the guy who just lost the US title not the guy who just won it\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026) by disposing of the [spinner belt]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQQhlq9fGhM&list=PLyLD4PmmFTq-siS0YKH0sRJVjTfChH4wI). With the message sent, it was Cena\u2019s chance to end the reign.\n\n**Wrestlemania 21** JBL vs John Cena \u2013 [Singles match]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xy3puz_jbl-vs-john-cena-wwe-championship_sport#.UX14BKVSXgQ)\n\nSo there you have it. JBL's title reign had come to an end, the longest running WWE champion of the last 10 years (as he put it) was no more. \n\nI hope you enjoyed my look at one of my personal favourite title runs of recent memory! \n",
