My father told me he thinks my debt problem will be difficult but not impossible I just shouldn't expect to own like a new car or new house.\n\n This is my first post here, I discovered this subreddit looking for a budget planner.  I'm just curious about how worried I should be about being in this much debt, and if there is anything I can do to help ease my burden when I'm out of college?
