  "selftext": "This is a legacy staple from an old, not well-opened set and has been on the rise for a while; just today, though, did it decide to actually spike. On TCG Player, there are only 32 copies (only six of which are non-foil; foils have long been around $55). Channel Fireball is sold out of regular copies, as is Starcity; they buy Tutors at $6 and $7 respectively. Coolstuff Inc. is out of stock at $12 with a buylist price of $6.50 and Card Kingdom buys them at $7 and has eleven left in stock between $10 and $12. This card has long been a staple in any deck with LED and is a cool card with a unique ability from an old set. It's been steadily going up for a while and now that a lot of legacy cards are spiking, this one is too. Please tell me what you think (especially whether foils are a reasonable buy). Thanks!",
