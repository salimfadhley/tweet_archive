Thanks, Glen, for filling in this week!\n\u00a0\n\nAfter graduating from pharmacy school in the late 70\u2019s, my primary career goal was to have my own chain of pharmacies that would give Walgreens a run for their money.\u00a0 Well, I did get my stores, but I eventually sold the prescription files to Walgreens after 10 years of effort. I joined the company in 1990 at one of our RxExpress locations in Chicago. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPrior to that, in the mid-late 80\u2019s, a new health scare appeared: AIDS. It wasn\u2019t until late\u00a0 1987 when the first HIV medication was marketed, but soon we learned that this drug and others that followed would not be magic bullets.\u00a0 Pharmacists, nurses and doctors did what they could to help people with AIDS stay alive, but it wasn\u2019t until 1996 that new life-saving drugs were released.\u00a0 These drugs were expensive, complicated to take, and came with side effects and strict dosing schedules.\u00a0 Along with this was the stigma that came along with the disease.\u00a0 People living with HIV had to find the right providers and pharmacists that were willing, able, and knowledgeable to help with this serious condition.\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1997, I was asked to operate a Walgreens pharmacy at a new health center in Chicago that would focus on the needs of the HIV/AIDS community. At that time, this type of pharmacy operation was considered a \u201cpilot\u201d program.\u00a0 Walgreens wasn\u2019t sure if this was a direction that the company should invest in. Although I had aspirations of other career paths within the company, I agreed to this project.\u00a0 This simple decision turned out to define the next 16 years for me. \u00a0Almost immediately, we learned that providing a focus on the needs of a specific patient population was well received by patients and providers alike.\n\u00a0\n\nFast forward to today, Walgreens has over $2 Billion dollars in sales of HIV drugs and we serve\u00a01/3 of all people in the U.S. living with HIV. Over 2000 of our pharmacists have been specially trained in providing care to HIV patients, \u00a0we have over 700 stores that are focused on HIV (called HIV Centers of Excellence), including 200 health system and Community Pharmacy branded locations.\n\u00a0\n\nToday, it is common to see our pharmacy staff, store staff, community leaders and local leadership stand up and support the community. Our employees all over the country are helping people who need information, support and sometimes a hug.\u00a0 No other national company has addressed this need as Walgreens has.\n\u00a0\n\nWe currently have hundreds of locations in health systems and communities focusing on complex health conditions, including HIV. Our specialty pharmacies help patients with oncology meds, transplant drugs, fertility and other complex regimens.\u00a0 Our pharmacists no longer take care of acute and chronic conditions; they\u2019re providing pharmaceutical care to patients who have serious or complicated conditions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf we look ahead and think about the potential with our partnerships with Alliance Boots and Amerisource, we will really be able to make a difference for people around the world with HIV and other conditions.\n\u00a0\n\nSo this is my story\u00a0how I got where I am with Walgreens. What about you? Is there something you\u2019re doing in your store or community that could change the direction of your career with Walgreens? What ideas are out there today that will become the next Billion dollar business in 5 or 10 years?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\u00a0\n\nBe well.\n\u00a0\n\nGlen \u00a0\n",
