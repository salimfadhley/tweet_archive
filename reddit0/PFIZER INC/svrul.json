It took me a while to man up to take this, partly because I loved smoking so much and didn&#39;t want to stop, partly because of the horrible side effects I read about this drug.  For me the process has been PAINLESS and NO side effects.  I followed the instructions on taking it to the letter and that may have helped with the no side effects part.  It is quite expensive but if you weight the costs (Health and monetary) against the price of chantix it is really not expensive at all. Been smoking a pack a day for 10 years (18-28) and I quit without even skipping a beat.  What amazes me is that I can still go drinking and not want a cigarette!!! This was HUGE for me.  </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR : Don&#39;t listen to all the bad reports, at least try chantix if you really want to quit</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
