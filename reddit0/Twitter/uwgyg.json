  "selftext": "I was at an Apple service provider waiting for an iPod Nano replacement when this guy who was talking to another Apple employee started threatening her. He was furious because she wouldn't replace his iPad. She was extremely (and unbelievably) patient and repeatedly tried to explain to him that the store was just an authorized service provider and not an Apple store and that they would need approval from Apple's regional office to replace his iPad. He asked for a piece of paper, scrawled his Twitter handle on it and repeatedly told the girl to check it to see how many followers he had. \"You'll be surprised,\" he said. \"I'll be tweeting about this. Show your manager and maybe they'll change their mind.\" He also said his number of followers \"will put a dent on Apple\" and that he'll never buy another Apple product again. He also repeatedly threw down his iPhone onto the counter to demonstrate that he couldn't break it. He was still at it when I left.  Nuts.\n\nEDIT: I jotted down the Twitter handle he gave the girl and looked it up when I got home. It's owned by some Canadian hockey player (200,000 + followers) who is in another part of the world and who looked nothing like the guy at the store. ",

  "title": "Today I watched a guy threaten an Apple retailer employee with his Twitter power. \"You'll be surprised at the number of followers I have. It will put a dent on Apple,\" he told her. Reddit, what act of douchebaggery have you witnessed lately? And did you do anything about it?"
