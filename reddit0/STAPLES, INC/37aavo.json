  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI purchased 2 $200 Visa gift cards at a Staples store today and as soon as the check out clerk saw what I wanted to purchase, she reached under her desk and took out a three ring binder with what I assume was directions for checking out certain items.  She seemed frazzled or nervous and kept shuffling the pages.  Then she asked with which card I wanted to pay.  I handed her my CC and ID, then she picked up the phone next to the register and called a number.  After a second she began typing in the credit card and expiration date, then hung up.  She then swiped my CC at her terminal, which didn't work, then swiped it for me at my terminal.  The transaction went through, she apologized for the delay and handed me my receipt.  I then left the store and checked my credit card activity, and it showed a duplicate charge...one for \"STAPLES\" and the other for \"Staples, Inc.\" Has anyone else had a clerk call a number and enter the CC info prior to swiping, resulting in two identical pending charges?  Do you all think this is fraud of some sort and should I close the CC account?",
