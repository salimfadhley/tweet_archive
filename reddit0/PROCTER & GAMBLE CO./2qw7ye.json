Which one would have been better for 2014?  Is there a way with the swappings of companies out of the top 10 and different weightings over the years one could calculate the same thing between say 1990 - 2014?  And not just stop at top 10.  Also data from top 20 and top 30, etc.\n\nI realize the weights don't add up to 100% but I think you would normalize the $100K among them so have the same top 10 weightings VTSAX does.",
