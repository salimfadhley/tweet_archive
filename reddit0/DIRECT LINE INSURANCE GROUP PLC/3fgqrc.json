  "selftext": "When i was around 17 i did a stupid thing to get my car insurance cancelled with Tesco insurance. I thought nothing of it and continued to get insurance normally without mentioning anything about being void until i was about about 23 and applied for direct line car insurance. \n\nEverything was fine until two months later i got a letter about non disclosure in the application saying that i have had insurance cancelled by Tesco in the past. They then continued to void my policy again. Ill probably never be able to get insurance with direct line and whoever underwrites for them again because of this. \n\nDo insurers not cross reference insurance information about cancelled/void policies with each other? Or is this because direct line and tesco have the same underwriters? \n\nI mentioned this whilst getting home insurance and they said that i don't have to mention being void on home insurance as its a different thing, is that correct? And if so, does that count for all insurance policies except motor insurance? \n\nAlso how long will i have to declare that i have had my insurance void/cancelled in the past. \n",
