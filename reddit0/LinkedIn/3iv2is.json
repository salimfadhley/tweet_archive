One of my professors sent out an email about getting ready for the first day of class and I realized he left everyone&#39;s email visible. My school has emails that are usually &quot;Firstname.Lastname&quot; so I thought o cool I can check out if there are any attractive girls in my class. So the FU happens because I decided to use my new LinkedIn account that I just made to look everyone up. About a day or two later I was telling my friend that there are cute girls in class when he asks how I knew. I told him I looked them up on LinkedIn and he just bursts out laughing and tells me that EVERYONE YOU LOOK UP ON LINKEDIN GETS A NOTIFICATION THAT YOU STALKED THEM. I had the class yesterday and we did an icebreaker where everyone had to shake hands, introduce themselves, and tell each other an interesting fact about themselves and I could barely even look them in the eye. Now i&#39;m dreading going to class next friday because every girl in class thinks I&#39;m a weirdo that specifically stalked them. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR I stalked every girl in class on LinkedIn and now I can barely even look at them without feeling ridiculously embarrassed</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
