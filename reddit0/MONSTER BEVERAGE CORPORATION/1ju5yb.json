Here's what I've got so far:\n\nAnnies Inc - BNNY\n\nWhole Foods Market Inc. - WFM\n\nMonster Beverage Corporation - MNST (owns Hansen's soda, peace tea, blue sky)\n\nHain Celestial Group Inc. - HAIN\n\nWhiteWave Foods - WWAV (owns silk and alpro)\n\nTofutti Brands Inc. - TOF\n\n\nI know these aren't completely veg companies (for example, whitewave also owns horizon organic dairy), but I'd like to see how well this could work. Also, later users can adjust the weights of each comapny to eliminate any they felt uncomfortable with. Any suggestions for other publicly traded companies?\n\nAlso, there are signup bonuses:\nDeposit $2000 and make 5 trades: you get $150.\nOr, get referred by an existing member, deposit $1000 and make 1 trade: you each get $100 (PM me if you're interested in a referral)",
