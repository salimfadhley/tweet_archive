She speaks 15 languages apparently. According to her bio, she spends her life traveling and picking up languages along the way.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s just one problem, Dagny Taggart doesn&#39;t exist. Her bio is fake, her profile picture is a stock photo. The books she writes are full of errors because they are written by a person (or perhaps a group of people) that doesn&#39;t actually speak the language and is just copying and writing in her own words what she learns from free language learning websites. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the glaring errors in her books that are obvious to anyone that can actually speak the language, her books are well reviewed, 4.5 out of 5 stars on almost every single one. There are the top selling books in every language category. How could this be? Dagny Taggart is paying for fake reviews, and it&#39;s working.</p>\n\n<p>I am an indie author. In full disclosure, I must inform the reader that Dagny Taggart is my direct competition. I am losing to her, and not just her, most of the best selling language learning ebooks are actually just scams. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a relatively easy scam. Go on the internet, look up some topic, usually one where a lot of general information can be learned online (languages, travel, diets, exercise, cooking) write it up in your own words into an ebook, get a professional cover, pay a company to write fake reviews for you, and BAM, you have a steady income stream. I estimate from my own sales that Dagny Taggart&#39;s books have scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars out of people in this year alone. </p>\n\n<p>So why hasn&#39;t Amazon put a stop to this? Why are fake reviews so rampant despite Amazon&#39;s best efforts? Amazon has taken a few actions. Recently, they have weighted the reviews of verified purchases, which is a good step, but can easily be overcome in the ebook world. Amazon has also brought lawsuits against the companies that sell fake reviews, another good step, but if there is a market for something, it will always exist.</p>\n\n<p>There is actually an easy fix to this scam. Something that Amazon has missed completely: <strong>average number of reviews over sales</strong>. My own book was downloaded over 5000 times in a three month period, which netted me 15 reviews. That&#39;s about 3 reviews per 1000 downloads. I imagine other products are similar, but the true statistics only Amazon knows. Some of Dagny Taggart&#39;s books received ten reviews on the very first day of publication. This past week, another scammer&#39;s book has received over 100 reviews (and counting). Could it be that they each had thousands of downloads on the very first day of publication, or during this past week? No, of course not. They paid professional reviews to astroturf.</p>\n\n<p>The simple solution is to red flag products that receive reviews in excess of the R/S ratio (reviews over sales), investigate the authors that are scamming the system, unpublish their works, refund their customers, and ban them from publishing again. Of course, there is a flaw in this as well, someone might pay a company to write fake reviews for their competition in order to get them banned, but if that competition were to contact Amazon and agree to delete the fake positive reviews, perhaps they could be forgiven. </p>\n\n<p>The big joke is, many of Amazon&#39;s top reviewers are professional astroturfers. The criminals have been given badges. It&#39;s easy to spot an astroturfer. Just click on their name. They write about ten book reviews a day. How many of you buy more than one book a day on Amazon, let alone buy and review it? They must be the fastest readers in the world! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ultimately, the problem lies in the consumers themselves.</strong> All the information I have told you in this article can easily be found out by anyone who takes the time to check the reviews of a product. In fact, for most of Dagny Taggart&#39;s books, the top review is a one star review that tells you all about the scam. A simple glance at the dates the reviews were published will tell you if a product received ten reviews in one hour. Unfortunately, the majority of ebook consumers don&#39;t take a few minutes to do their due diligence, they just look for the stars, and so the best selling books remain the ones with the most positive reviews. You may say it&#39;s their own fault, buyer beware, but in the end this will hurt all indie publishers when readers realize their purchases were a scam, and lead them to trust Amazon&#39;s review system and indie publishers less and less. </p>\n\n<p>What can we do to get Amazon to implement the simple fix of red flagging works that receive too many reviews per sales? What other solutions do you think would be a good idea? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Dagny&#39;s lawyer has contacted me, thoughts? Can I actually be sued for reddit posts? </p>\n\n<p>Dear goans314,</p>\n\n<p>I am the lawyer of the publishing company that owns Dagny Taggart&#39;s book rights on Amazon. </p>\n\n<p>Today you uploaded an outrageously defamatory post attacking my client on Reddit.
