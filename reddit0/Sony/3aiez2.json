I think exclusive content, timed content and simply bought exclusive that would otherwise been multi-format are bad practice but I don't think Sony should be taking all the bad / negative comments when seemingly MS get off (relatively speaking, I know MS do receive stick for it as well) free when they do the same thing. \n\n",
