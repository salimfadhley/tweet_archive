  "selftext": "Hey everyone, new to this subreddit and the website in general. I might as well start out with why I'm doing this today. I grew up with my father and grandfather, both ex-military, watching nothing but the history channel. Looked up to the both of them, and as I grew older I realized the opportunities this country has given both myself and them and I've always wanted to give something back. Going through highschool with moderate grades, my initial plan was to enlist. I wanted to badly but I will be one of the first in the family to finish college, and realized I would have to make the compromise. In sophomore year, USMA and ROTC became options, but my grades would not make the cut. I ran and lifted all through highschool and the PFT was no problem, but it was the grades that were holding me back (low GPA, exceptional SAT). Touring the USMA was thrilling, but i gradually realized the Army is not where I would be satisfied, and the caliber of human being accepted into the Academy these days is nothing my transcript showed. \n\nI did apply to NROTC (marine option), did not receive a scholarship and was told it wouldn't really even be worth it to compete as a college programmer. Now finishing up my Freshman year, the PLC program surfaced and really drew my attention. I contacted my OSO last week and I will be meeting with him to start up my paperwork this thursday. My OSO told me based on my crudentials that I will be a strong candidate for the program, and I really hope I am accepted. I have a few questions toward the end regarding PLCJ/PLCS. I really wanted to enlist, to start as a grunt and work my way up but the need for college in what I eventually want to do held me back. Although excited to (hopefully) commission eventually and confident in my abilities, I will try my absolute hardest to be humble and learn from my enlisted equivalents. I can imagine nothing is worse than someone completely inexperienced telling you what to do. \n\nThis post was primarily to introduce myself, but I do have a few questions if you guys don't mind.\n\n1. How strong of a candidate for PLC am I?\n* 3mi Run: Most likely in the high 19's, low 20's right now but I'm running everyday and am completely confident I will be in the 18's by the time my PFT rolls around.\n* Pullups: Max\n* Situps: Max\n* GPA (Cum): 3.2x\n* Major: Mechanical Engineering\n* I am respectful, decently well composed and confident. Hope that helps.\n* Desired MOS: Infantry Officer. I wanted to enlist as 03xx, so an IO is where I would like to end up.\n2. Any tips for filing PLC paperwork? (References, etc.)\n3. Advice for preparing my running for the PFT?\n4. Regarding PLCJ/PLCS, I am having trouble deciding when I should do each. I go to a 5 year college, so I have an extra summer. I would love to start PLC next summer, but if i do PLCJ/S consecutive, which i believe is required, I would have an empty summer before my comission. Is there any program I can go through during that empty summer?\n5. Any tips for MEPS? \n\nThank you all for your time.",
