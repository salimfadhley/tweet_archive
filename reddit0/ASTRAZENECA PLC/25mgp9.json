Clearly Pfizer is targeting AstraZeneca's cancer drug AZD 9291 (which has shown  good results during clinical trials). A combination of Pfizer and AstraZeneca would create an entity that could give current oncological leaders Roche and Novartis a run for their money.\n\nRegulatory clearance has not been gotten for the bid yet. Further, AstraZeneca's boss has said Pfizer's bid ain't good enough, putting pressure on them to bump up their offer. Not a good thing for Pfizer, I guess.\n\nI am getting a June 2015 fair value of US$31.98 for Pfizer. It seems if one uses a 10-15% safety margin one should look to get in at $27.18-28.78. Yesterday's close $29.10. RSI of around 35 also shows that the stock is not yet oversold.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Wait or get in now? Views much appreciated. Thanks.",
