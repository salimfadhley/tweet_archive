As far as I knew he was some sort of analyst, but I'm starting to doubt that now. So on Monday I came home from school (I'm in college but live with my parents) and my dad was home already and he was drunk. He told me my mom called him at work and told him she was moving out and when he came home she was gone. \n\n\nSo my dad is devastated and he's been drinking heavily but he is also in the middle of some sort of cyber meeting in his office. I can hear him talking and slurring and finally I guess they hang up on him because he throws something and then like run/stumbles out of the office and in to the bathroom and pukes and then lays down on the floor. \n\n\nSo I go into his office to pour out as much liquor as I can without him noticing and his computer screen just says \"CALL ENDED\" or something to that effect. I'm never allowed in his office so I start snooping a little. \n\n\nI see his work briefcase type thing is unlocked and I start pulling out files, I don't know why, I'm naturally curious. I read as much as I could and I took pictures with my phone because I didn't think my friends would believe me. I deleted the pics the next day because I freaked the fuck out and didn't want them on my phone.  Here's what I committed to memory. \n______________________________________\nThe files were: \n\n**- Carnival Majesty**\n\nA cruise ship that sank in the Atlantic Ocean. December 2009\n1,940 lives lost\n\n\n**- Norwegian Omni**\n\nA cruise ship that sank in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. July 2010\n6,102 lives lost. \n\n\n**- Royal Caribbean Luster of the Seas**\n\nCruise ship that sank in the Pacific Ocean. February 2011\n2,070 lives lost\n\n**- Moon Princess**\n\nCruise ship that sank in the Pacific Ocean. September 2011\n2,181 lives lost\n\n\n**- Pearl Princess**\n\nCruise ship that sank in the Atlantic Ocean. April 2012\n~ 3,400 lives lost\n\n**- Carnival Euphoria** \n\nCruise ship that sank in the Pacific Ocean. November 2012\n~2,800 lives lost\n\n**- Disney Reverie**\n\nCruise ship that sank in the Atlantic Ocean. June 2013\n3,303 lives lost\n\n**- Royal Caribbean Temptation of the Seas**\n\nCruise ship that sank in the Atlantic Ocean. January 2014\n6,156 lives lost\n\n___________________________\n\nOkay, so even though I KNOW I would have heard of these tragedies before, I  scoured the internet anyway. The only thing I found was one misspelled reference (\"Euphora\")to the Carnival Euphoria, an image file. This morning I checked again and it was gone. The page, which I had bookmarked, was 404. \n\nThese cruise ships don't even have Wikipedia pages. All the files included pictures of the ships and passenger lists. None of them had any information about what sunk the ships. \n\nDude, I don't even know. When I got up the next morning at 6 for class my dad was already gone, and his laptop, his files, everything was gone too. He didn't come home on Tuesday and this morning I got a text from him - a service my dad's phone doesn't even have - that he was going to be in Atlanta this week and next week. His suitcases are still in the closet and I'm fucking panicking. \n\nI'm seriously freaking out. What should I do?\n\n\n\n",
