But in this case, they were wrestling with competing recommendations, including a separate report from the agency\u2019s economic bureau that didn\u2019t favor legal action.\n\nThen-Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in a written statement at the time that Google\u2019s voluntary changes deliver \u201cmore relief for American consumers faster than any other option.\u201d\n\nGoogle General Counsel Kent Walker said in a statement Thursday that the FTC ultimately \u201cagreed that there was no need to take action on how we rank and display search results.\u201d He added: \u201cSpeculation about potential consumer harm turned out to be entirely wrong. Since the investigation closed two years ago, the ways people access information online have only increased, giving consumers more choice than ever before.\u201d\n\nOn one issue\u2014whether Google used anticompetitive tactics for its search engine\u2014the competition staff recommended against a lawsuit, although it said Google\u2019s actions **resulted in \u201csignificant harm\u201d to rivals. In three other areas, the report found evidence the company used its monopoly behavior to help its own business and hurt its rivals.**\nENLARGE\n\nThe report undercuts Google\u2019s oft-stated contention that the FTC found no evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cThe conclusion is clear: Google\u2019s services are good for users and good for competition,\u201d said David Drummond, Google\u2019s senior vice president and chief legal officer, when the FTC closed the matter.\n\nIt could prompt new complaints from some Google competitors, such as Yelp Inc., who allege the company still engages in anticompetitive behavior, and renewed focus by antitrust authorities in Europe, who are pursuing their own look into Google.\n\n\u201cThis document appears to show that the FTC had direct evidence from Google of intentional search bias,\u201d said Luther Lowe, the vice president of public policy for Yelp.\nENLARGE\n\nThe Wall Street Journal viewed portions of the document after the agency **inadvertently disclosed it** as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. The FTC declined to release the undisclosed pages and asked the Journal to return the document, which it declined to do.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, an unredacted version of this material was inadvertently released in response to a FOIA request,\u201d an FTC spokesman said in a statement to the Journal. \u201cWe are taking steps to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nEmbedded in the document and in detailed footnotes are an array of previously unknown details about Google\u2019s business, many of which come from senior officials such as Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, former executive Marissa Mayer and co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nData included in the report suggest Google was more dominant in the U.S. Internet search market than was widely believed. The company estimated its market share at between 69% and 84% during a period when research firm comScore put it at 65%. \u201cFrom an antitrust perspective, I\u2019m happy to see [comScore] underestimate our share,\u201d the report quoted Google Chief Economist Hal Varian as saying, without specifying the context.\n\n**An antitrust suit against Google would have pitted Obama administration appointees against one of the White House\u2019s closest corporate allies**. Google was the second-largest corporate source of campaign donations to President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election effort. Google executives have visited the White House scores of times since Mr. Obama has been in office, according to visitor logs.\n\n\u201cThe FTC is an independent agency and we respect their independent decision-making,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman.\n\nIn its investigation, FTC staff said Google\u2019s conduct \u201chelped it to maintain, preserve and enhance Google\u2019s monopoly position in the markets for search and search advertising\u201d **in violation of the law**. Google\u2019s behavior \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d the report said.\n\nGoogle has long disputed any characterization that it is a monopoly, saying that competition is \u201cjust a click away.\u201d\n\nIn discussing one of the issues the FTC staff wanted to sue over, the report said **the company illegally took content from rival websites** such as Yelp, TripAdvisor Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to improve its own websites. It cited one instance when Google copied Amazon\u2019s sales rankings to rank its own items. It also copied Amazon\u2019s reviews and ratings, the report found. Spokesmen for TripAdvisor and Amazon declined to comment.\n\n**When competitors asked Google to stop taking their content, it threatened to remove them from its search engine.**\n[Do no evil?]\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Google\u2019s threat was intended to produce, and did produce, the desired effect,\u201d the report said, \u201cwhich was to coerce Yelp and TripAdvisor into backing down.\u201d The company also sent a message that it would \u201cuse its monopoly power over search to extract the fruits of its rivals\u2019 innovations.\u201d\n\nIn its final agreement, the commission secured a promise that Google would allow websites to opt out of having their content included in its competing search products.\n\nThe staff said **Google also broke antitrust law** by placing restrictions on websites that publish its search results from also working with rivals such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yahoo Inc.\n\nThe commission made no mention of this issue in its final report, nor did it secure any commitments from Google to change its policies.\n\nIn a third area, the FTC staff said **Google violated antitrust law** by restricting advertisers\u2019 ability to use data garnered from Google ad campaigns in advertising run on rival platforms.\n\nThe FTC report cited a Google employee who said the company once wanted to do away with the unnecessary restriction but was overruled by Mr. Page, who is now Google\u2019s chief executive. A Google spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Page available for comment.\n\nUltimately, Google changed this policy voluntarily in 2013 at the behest of the agency.\n\nOn the most important issue, that of Google\u2019s prized search engine, the FTC report said **Google altered it to benefit its own services at the expense of rivals**. The report said Google \u201cadopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.\u201d\n\nIn what it termed \u201ca close call,\u201d the staff said the FTC shouldn\u2019t issue a complaint against the company because of legal hurdles and Google\u2019s \u201cstrong procompetitive justifications.\u201d\n\n    \u2018[Google\u2019s behavior] helped it to maintain, preserve and enhance Google\u2019s monopoly position in the markets for search and search advertising\u2019\n    \u2014FTC staff report \n\nThe \u201cevidence paints a complex portrait of a company working toward an overall goal of maintaining its market share by providing the best user experience, while simultaneously engaging in tactics that resulted in harm to many vertical competitors, and likely helped to entrench Google\u2019s monopoly power over search and search advertising,\u201d the staff said.\n\nOn Jan. 3, the five FTC commissioners voted to close the investigation. A few months later, now FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez told a Senate committee that a majority of commissioners didn\u2019t support a case against Google on any of the allegations under investigation.\n\nWrite to Brody Mullins at brody.mullins@wsj.com, Rolfe Winkler at rolfe.winkler@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com\n   \n\nCopyright \u00a92015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
