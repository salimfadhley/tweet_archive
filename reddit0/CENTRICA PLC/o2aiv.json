Honestly, I thought it had to do with a religion based on science. \"Good for Tom,\" I thought to myself. Then I figured out how utterly fucking stupid Scientology is, if I recall correctly, through a South Park episode. Since then I have been unable to watch his old or new movies. I just can't get over the fact of how much of an idiot you have to be to subject yourself to such stupidity. \n\nIt's not that I'm \"missing out\" on Tom Cruise movies that's the point here. I'm just wondering if anyone else has an aversion to his acting, like I do, knowing his religion and how crazy it is. \n\nAnd yes, most religions are pretty crazy, but Scientology pretty much tops the list..... And maybe Mormonism. ",
