  "selftext": "First off, I want to apologize for posting another one of these threads. I've browsed the subreddit a bit and noticed almost every other post is a question similar to this.\n\nI'm a currently enlisted Electrician's Mate in the Navy, on the nuclear side. Went through a pretty strenuous 2-year training period that covered everything from AC/DC circuits, Solid State circuits, microprocessors to Atomic Physics, Fluid Dynamics, Heat Transfer, Chemistry, Radiation Fundamentals, and some Material Science. I'm separating in a couple months, and despite being offered a couple jobs in the 70-90k range (most were working on PLCs, generators, or as a Grid Operator), I decided I was going to start school in the fall instead. I had planned on doing Electrical Engineering, if only because I figured that would complement my experience more than anything else. But one of the reasons I decided to go to school is because I really didn't see myself working on typical electrical equipment for the rest of my life. I want to do something more meaningful. Then I \"discovered\" Biomedical Engineering, watched a couple introduction courses form MIT/Yale, got really interested in it, and I think I found my calling. \n\nSo my question is the standard question that gets asked here all the time. Should I undergrad in Biomedical or stick to Electrical, or maybe even Mechanical? I've read the answers to these questions asked previously and I know the common response to do Electrical or Mechanical instead, but I was thinking since I already have a decent resume/background in Electrical theory/maintenance/troubleshooting, that Id have a better shot at landing a job with just a Biomed undergrad than your typical person. \n\nIf it matters, I do plan on eventually earning my masters. Being from Texas, I'd be stupid not to, since I have both the GI Bill and Hazelwood Act to use up.\n\nThanks for reading.",
