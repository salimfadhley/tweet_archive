Something I need to add real quick is that this building has pillars as aesthetics around it. So basically hiding places for DI's/Marines and as recruits we are supposed to sound off when we see anyone. \n\nFlaming feet over here is 50 yards away when not 20 feet away a marine pops up around a pillar that I never even fucking saw and basically calls out a friendly but frustrated excuse me. Instantly GOOD AFTERNOON SIR! At this point I've only seen a little bit of this Marines dress blues as he's still a little hidden. Slowly I see he's stacked, ribbons galore, and then FUCKING BAM! CHEVRONS! \n\nMy ass is staring straight at SgtMjr of the Marine Corps. Recruit GLU almost fucking didn't fucking sound off to the SgtMjr of the Marine Corps. Had he decided to say something to someone, the smoking I would have gotten would have killed me. Or better yet, had he decided to smoke me himself I could sit here and say I got smoked by non other than a SgtMjr of the Marine Corps. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to add in there at some point that he was on his cell phone the entire time which is 100% the whole reason I didn't get fucked. \n\nEDIT 2: I'll add that this was SgtMjr of the Marine Corps Carlton Kent.
