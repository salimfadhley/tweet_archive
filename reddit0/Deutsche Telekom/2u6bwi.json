  "selftext": "Good morning folks,\n\nWe presented (primary ISP) with all of the traceroutes you posted and with [charts that we created based on your ping data](http://i.imgur.com/elm0zSO.png). They discovered that their peer link to DTAG (Deutsche Telekom) is 90% saturated during EU primetime. This link handles the majority of the traffic to both Miller and Cobalt.\n\n\n\nThe bad news is that while (primary ISP) acknowledges the problem, there is little they can do in the short term to fix the situation.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that (secondary ISP) has more than enough bandwidth to handle the route. EU servers are down now to switch over to the secondary ISP, and should be back up again in an hour or so.\n\n\n\nPlease use this thread to provide feedback and traceroutes during primetime. You should notice a sizable decrease in latency and packet loss, both via ICMP and the in-game ping meter. Please remember that this fix is only going to affect DTAG customers, and that this fix will NOT improve latency due to high server load.\n\n\nThanks again for your continued patience.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: We're looking into issues with Miller. Miller and Cobalt both share the same network infrastructure - not sure why Cobalt is healthy and Miller isn't.\n\nUPDATE 2: Miller is back baby!",
