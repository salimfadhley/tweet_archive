  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nEastern suburbs Melbournian here. \n\nI've recently been headhunted and have been given an amazing opportunity to work in a role which I could get a lot of experience from. Only issue is, it's in Tullamarine - and the only way to avoid a daily 3+ hour commute would be to move. \n\nCan anyone tell me what suburbs are somewhat decent; with a commute of less than half an hour each way? \n\nI want to be \"somewhere safe\". I know that is rare these days, but I'm on my own. My family and friends all live in the Ringwood/Knox region. \n\nCurrently living on my own and intend on keeping it that way. \n\nAny suggestions welcomed.\n\nThank you. ",
