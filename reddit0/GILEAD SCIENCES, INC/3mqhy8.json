  "selftext": "I recently started a new job and was finally able to sign up for my 401(k) plan after a month (26, making $53k/year). I choose the traditional plan and have a company match on the first 6% (50% in company stock and other 50% to my fund of choice) I chose to allocate all of my funds to the Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX). I was initially going to just put everything into the Vanguard 2055 target date fund but did not want that much exposure to international stocks and bonds. I'm just wondering if this is WAY to risky for someone my age and if the expense ratio is to high at 0.82%. \n\nThe top holdings of the fidelity fund are as follows:\nApple Inc\t- 5.80\t\t\t\t\nSalesforce.com Inc - 4.14\t\nGoogle Inc Class A - 3.06\t\nAmazon.com Inc\t - 2.89\t\nFacebook Inc Class A - 2.49\t\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc - 2.28\t\nGoogle Inc Class C Capital Stock - 2.03\t\nNVIDIA Corp - 1.80\t\nGilead Sciences Inc - 1.71\t\nAlkermes PLC - 1.67\t\n \nThese holdings and the track record of this fund (since 1983 it has achieved a 13.18% average annual total return) were the main reason for me choosing this over a Vanguard Target Date Fund.
