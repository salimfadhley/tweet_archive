With the chance of a revolutionary discovery, superb margins, and extremely good recent performance, it might even make sense. Gilead Sciences Inc is very cheap relative to the category. And that's not because they're a poor company. They have a rich pipeline, excellent margins and a very large competitive competitive advantage in the Hep C market, through Harvoni. The patent expires in 2018, meaning that they have 3 years before they'll need to find a new source of revenue. Currently, they have 3 HIV drugs pending regulatory approval.

MU produces NAND and DRAM, critical parts of high-tech computer products. Think of them as making chips that all smartphones, data centres and computers need. If you think people will buy a lot of those in the future, a stock like MU lets you profit without buying the companies directly. With all this talk of the next billion, the post-PC era and the power of the cloud, it seems like the future of computing can go many ways. And with overvalued, ovethyped companies like Salesforce, a cheaply valued company that profits no matter who else does seems like a dream come true. However, you still need to know about the bear in the room: MU's bad quarter. Reading the 10-Q shows that margin reductions appear again and again. Quite simply, they sold more, but sold it for less. The reductions in DRAM prices were too fast, and they couldn't reduce the production costs quuckly enough to keep up. They'll need new technology to maintain healthy margins. They happen to have a partnership with Intel, working on creating a new form of memory that seems nearly revolutionary. 3dXpoint memory is poised to be 1000x times faster than NAND, meaning that large data centres have access to a new product that vastly outperforms their old one, letting them work with extremely large amounts of data. However, Micron is not without unique risks:\n\n-Margins worsening further\n-3dXpoint not delivering what was promised\n-Weakening PC/mobile/datacenter markets\n\nThese risks are significant, no doubt. I advise caution when considering stock allocation, as it depends on how bullish you are on the future of the PC markets. I consider MU  a buy; or a strong buy if you're bullish on computing.\n\nFinally, just an idea: Citibank has a P/B of 0.77, and a P/C of 0.28, according to Finviz.com. That sounds good, at least. Any advice?",
