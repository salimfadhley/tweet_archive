This is true, but it is part of any basic supply/demand model.  Also true are the makers who serve up lower quality NAS to take advantage of the increase in demand.

This being said, collecting now is the way to build a war chest to protect from the inevitable increase in prices and decrease in quality.  While quality offerings will surely be released, they will be at premium prices ala Remy Cointreau and LVMH models.  The use of the travel retail model is an obvious push to increase further global demand to non-scotch drinking countries aka China.  </p>\n\n<p>When global taste turns further to scotch, the inevitable demand spike will, for premium bottles, probably be a 3-5x increase in prices.  So the best hedge for the current scotch enthusiast is to build a comprehensive collection comprised of collector high end scotch to trade with in the future and your daily drinker of choice which will be scarcer and more expensive in the very near future.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure I will probably get flamed and downvoted for expressing this opinion and topic, but I really think that if you are a lover of scotch it will pay to prepare - for as one redditor put it - the &quot;whisky apocalypse&quot;.  </p>\n\n<p>Cheers.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
