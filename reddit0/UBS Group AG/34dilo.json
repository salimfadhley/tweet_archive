CASEY April 29, 2015 11:04 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.  \n  \nGoldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology\u2019s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.  \n  \nCircle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.  \n  \nThe new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.  \n  \nGoldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank\u2019s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees \u201csignificant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.\u201d  \n    \nCircle said in a statement that the investment bank\u2019s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm\u2019s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.  \n  \nThe funding news coincides with Circle\u2019s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.  \n  \nAlso joining the investment round were Circle\u2019s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms\u2019 individual contributions weren\u2019t disclosed.  \n  \nGoldman\u2019s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain\u2019s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.  \n  \nAlso, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin\u2014its so-called \u201cblockchain\u201d digital ledger.  \n  \nThe strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm\u2019s founding philosophy.  \n  \n\u201cWe\u2019ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,\u201d Mr. Allaire said in an interview.  \n  \nDollar account holders\u2019 funds will reside with Circle\u2019s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.  \n  \nUnlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own \u201cclosed-loop\u201d networks, Circle\u2019s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm\u2019s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.  \n  \nCircle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba\u2019s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent\u2019s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China \u201can extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,\u201d highlighting the Chinese government\u2019s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.  \n  \nIt is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a \u201cSuperwallet\u201d for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.  \n  \n\u201cThe opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,\u201d says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners\u2014both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments with IDG.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n-------  \n###Peganalysis  \n-------  \n  \nSo what else do you need to see?  Blythe Masters is working in bitcoin space, the first bitcoin exchange fund will begin trading soon, and now Goldman Sachs can't even afford to ignore bitcoin any longer.  \n  \nBerkshire Hathaway, 2.92% owner of Goldman Sachs, just caused Mr. Buffet to make his first investment in the emerging tech universe of cryptocurrency.  Why?  *Because it's a smart move!*  \n  \nIt might hurt to admit that I'm right on this one, but I am.  2016 is going to see bitcoin prices way, **way** higher than piddly $220 each.  \n  \nThe financial universe can only send you so many wakeup calls.  It would be foolish not to have at least 1% of your portfolio in bitcoin or bitcoin-related tech at this point.  \n\n",
