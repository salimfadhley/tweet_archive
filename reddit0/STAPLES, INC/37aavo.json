She seemed frazzled or nervous and kept shuffling the pages.  Then she asked with which card I wanted to pay.  I handed her my CC and ID, then she picked up the phone next to the register and called a number.  After a second she began typing in the credit card and expiration date, then hung up.  She then swiped my CC at her terminal, which didn&#39;t work, then swiped it for me at my terminal.  The transaction went through, she apologized for the delay and handed me my receipt.  I then left the store and checked my credit card activity, and it showed a duplicate charge...one for &quot;STAPLES&quot; and the other for &quot;Staples, Inc.&quot; Has anyone else had a clerk call a number and enter the CC info prior to swiping, resulting in two identical pending charges?  Do you all think this is fraud of some sort and should I close the CC account?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
