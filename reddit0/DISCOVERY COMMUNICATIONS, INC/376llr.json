You can also see the same grey frame at the beginning.\n\nThis is \"his\" video (uploaded May 5th): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJRANXgW9Ws\n\n---------\n\nProLoLVods also takes videos from this channel called \"Bjergsen Solo Queue\"\n\nBjergsen Solo Queue video (uploaded Feb 7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1u-WhuHdQ \n\n\"His\" video (uploaded Feb 10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJFnl-CKOVg\n\nAgain, same length quality etc.. both of them say 36:01 in YouTube search but when clicked on, it'll be 36:00 in actual length. \n\n---------\n\nNow of course, these YouTubers do not own Bjergsen's or WildTurtle's content/gameplay but Bjergsen or WildTurtle do not really care about people uploading their videos to YouTube - Tekk asks streamers for permission before uploading their vods...\n\nBUT reuploading videos that someone took their time to watch and record on Twitch is annoying since they took the time to do all that work and I know Tekk takes the time to remove copyrighted music from his videos too. The reuploader just rips it off a channel and reupload it without doing any work. Watching and recording is fine because of the work they put in (under fair use?) whereas directly ripping from a YouTube channel is NOT because it is against YouTube's policy\n\n",
