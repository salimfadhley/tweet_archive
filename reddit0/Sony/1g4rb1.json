Now going back to the PS3 and Xbox360 the biggest argument for PS was that online did not cost money, another policy based on increasing income. Well now it turns out Sony followed suit and will require pay-to-play online multiplayer.\n\nSo my point is, is Sony really a hero or are they just letting Microsoft test the waters and then following right behind? Will Sony again sit back mocking Microsoft as they bare the burden of evolving the business model to increase income, and once it's done and the public outrage calms then Sony will copy?",
