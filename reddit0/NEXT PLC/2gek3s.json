  "selftext": "I am currently in my freshman year of college and working with an OSO. I plan to (provided that I get selected) go to PLC Jrs. next summer. However, if I am not able to go next summer, there is an NROTC unit at my college. I can enroll in the College program with the unit as a sophomore, and I was thinking I might do so if I do not get selected for PLC Jrs. for next summer. If I end up in NROTC and am able to continue after my sophomore year (on scholarship) then I will have my last two years of college paid for in full. On the other hand, if I'm not able to continue with NROTC, then I can still try and get selected for PLC Combined. So in light of all this, I was just wondering what NROTC on the Marine option side is like? Would NROTC be a good option? Or should I stay on the PLC route?",
