He is pushing hard to sell 500,000 vehicles a year by 2020, up from 90 a day in the third quarter. And giant auto makers are on a collision course with Tesla like never before, with General Motors Co. showing off a new electric car at the Detroit auto show on Monday.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s response? He says he doesn\u2019t plan to change a thing, from his proclivity for F-bombs to double duty as chief executive of rocket makerSpace Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, to a hands-on obsession with the tiniest operational and car-design details at Tesla.\n\nHe calls himself a \u201cnano-manager,\u201d works about 100 hours a week and still runs the auto maker largely as he did before it sold the first Tesla Roadster in 2008.\n\n\u201cI have OCD on product-related issues,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI always see what\u2019s... wrong. Would you want that? When I see a car or a rocket or spacecraft, I only see what\u2019s wrong. I never see what\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a recipe for happiness.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a speech Tuesday at an auto-show event, Mr. Musk is expected to criticize larger auto makers for not responding to Tesla even more aggressively. He denounces the rest of the industry as only halfheartedly trying to produce battery-powered cars for the masses, not just early adopters.\n\nMore than a decade after launching Tesla, the 43-year-old Mr. Musk has gained lots of believers in his brash, iconoclastic quest to run gas guzzlers off the road. Tesla is worth $26 billion in stock-market value, nearly half the size of GM or Ford Motor Co. GM sold more than 27,000 new vehicles a day in the third quarter\u2014or about 90 every five minutes.\n\nPanasonic Corp. will invest as much as $2 billion toward the $5 billion cost of Tesla\u2019s new lithium-ion battery factory, under construction in Nevada. The state approved $1.3 billion in tax breaks and other incentives for Tesla, among the most ever in the U.S. for any company.\n\nFuturis Automotive is getting a new factory the size of three football fields in Newark, Calif., ready to rev up production of seats and headliners for Tesla, which builds its Model S sedans nearby. Headliners are attached to the inside roof of cars.\n\n\u201cWe decided to move into the Bay Area because we believe in what Tesla is trying to do,\u201d says Sam Coughlin, Futuris\u2019s top executive in the U.S. He plans to double the number of jobs at the factory this year, including engineers wooed away from Detroit.\n\nJust 0.3% of the new vehicles registered in the U.S. since the start of 2012 are fully electric-powered, according to IHS Automotive, part of IHS Inc. Tesla had more than 20% of all electric-car sales in that period.\n\nTesla\u2019s growing size is one reason why Audi AG , the premium-car brand owned by Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG , is working on a compact sport-utility vehicle designed to go 300 miles on an electric charge, according to Audi executives. Tesla plans to start selling its new Model X sport-utility vehicle in the third quarter of 2015.\n\nSpaceX Stumbles in Test to Show Reusable Rocket Technology Advances\nGM\u2019s new Chevrolet Bolt would be aimed directly at Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Model 3 and capable of traveling 200 miles with one charge, according to people familiar with the strategy. A concept version of the Bolt will be unveiled at the industry\u2019s biggest annual event, the North American International Auto Show, which starts Monday.\n\nThe Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid introduced by GM in 2010, has an electric range of just 38 miles, though next year\u2019s model will go 50 miles.\n\nSome Tesla investors are jittery, pushing the Palo Alto, Calif., company\u2019s share price down more than 10% in the past three months, compared with gains by GM, Ford and major U.S. stock indexes during the same period.\n\nAnalysts at some securities firms are worried that the 40% slide in gasoline prices at the pump since Aprilmight hurt demand for electric cars. Tesla shares also are being hurt by concerns that a several-month delay in the Model X rollout will make it harder for Mr. Musk to hit the 2020 sales target.\n\nBut because of the unwavering intensity of Mr. Musk\u2019s determination, investors have flocked to Tesla and shrug off the fact that the auto maker has never made an annual profit. They don\u2019t care that the Model S usually sells for more than $100,000, or about double the company\u2019s original projection.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2014, Tesla had revenue of $2.24 billion, up 60% from a year earlier. Its net loss grew to $186.4 million from $57.7 million.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of investors whose main thesis is based on Elon Musk and his vision for the future of vehicles,\u201d says Colin Langan, an auto-industry analyst at UBS AG. He has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on Tesla shares.\n\nCristiano Carlutti is more blunt. He ran Tesla\u2019s operations in Europe before leaving in 2011 for startup auto makerQoros Auto Co., where he is a top executive. Tesla was \u201cdriven and is still driven by Elon Musk,\u201d says Mr. Carlutti. \u201cYou take Elon out of the company, [and] the market cap would go down 80%.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk says the auto maker has \u201ccertainly gotten a lot of attention, but we make very few cars, so the effect is small. The value that Tesla can provide is\u2026an example of what is possible.\u201d\n\nHe said when Tesla stock hit $280 last year that it was probably too high. According to the company\u2019s latest proxy filing, Mr. Musk owns a 27% stake worth about $7.2 billion based on Friday\u2019s closing price of $206.66.\n\nWith characteristic directness, Mr. Musk admits Tesla has no succession plan. The company also has suffered from growing pains because of his domineering presence.\n\nSome high-level managers quit or were fired after clashing with the chief executive over Mr. Musk\u2019s insistence on doing things his way, according to interviews with dozens of current and former Tesla executives.\n\nDuring the launch of Model S production in 2012, Mr. Musk set up an office in the middle of the factory floor in Fremont, Calif., and took over when hiccups emerged. He told workers to buy USB cables at nearby Fry\u2019s Electronics Inc. stores after a snarl delayed a shipment from China.\n\n\u201cIf you are fighting a battle, it\u2019s way better if you are at the front lines. A general behind the lines is going to lose,\u201d he says.\n\nElon Musk, right, and Peter Thiel, shown in 2000, made a fortune when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.4 billion. \nElon Musk, right, and Peter Thiel, shown in 2000, made a fortune when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.4 billion. \nThree weeks before the first Model S was delivered to a customer, Mr. Musk demanded that the sedans have larger rear tires because he felt they looked better, according to people involved in the process. The last-minute design switch also required complicated tweaks to the car\u2019s anti-lock braking system and carried the risk of shortening the car\u2019s driving range.\n\nTesla engineers protested that the electronics supplier might not honor its liability warranty if Mr. Musk went through with the bigger tires.\n\nMr. Musk didn\u2019t back down. The engineers did. And the design change went through without a hitch, says someone who was in the room when the decision was made.\n\nCurrent and former Tesla executives say few people are willing to disagree openly with Mr. Musk. Those who fall out of sync with him often don\u2019t stay long. Turnover in the auto industry can be especially problematic because it takes several years to design and roll out new models.\n\nLast month, the chief of Tesla\u2019s operations in China, Veronica Wu, left the company after being there for only one year. Tesla hasn\u2019t announced the reason for her sudden departure, and she didn\u2019t respond to emails or other attempts to contact her.\n\nMr. Musk \u201cis very, very demanding, and it\u2019s not the right speed for a lot of people,\u201d says Ricardo Reyes, who left Tesla in 2012 as its vice president of public relations and was rehired in November when his successor quit after about six months on the job.\n\nENTREPRENEUR\u2019S STEADY SUCCESS\n\n1999: Elon Musk, at 28, sells mapping-software company for $307 million, earning $22 million.\n\n2002: Gets huge payday from PayPal\u2019s sale to eBay for $1.4 billion, starts SpaceX.\n\n2004: Invests in Tesla and becomes fledging auto maker\u2019s chairman.\n\n2008: Tesla delivers first battery-powered Roadster. Falcon 1 rocket makes successful launch. Musk becomes Tesla\u2019s CEO.\n\n2010: Tesla goes public.\n\n2012: Model S sedan is delivered to first customer.\n\n2014: SpaceX wins $2.6 billion NASA contract to send astronauts to International Space Station. Tesla picks Nevada as site for $5 billion battery \u2018gigafactory.\u2019 Company\u2019s stock-market value tops $30 billion.\n\nBefore that, Tesla went nearly two years without a director of the public-relations department.\n\nThe car maker\u2019s CEO \u201cpushes really hard, and it\u2019s mission driven. It\u2019s constant activity,\u201d Mr. Reyes adds. \u201cHe used to say that he only wanted \u2018special forces\u2019 working for him. No normal people.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk agrees that he can be exacting but denies that he fires employees without reason or cause. \u201cI don\u2019t like to fire people. I hate it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe issue I\u2019ve had is firing people too late, not too early.\u201d\n\nMedia relations have been largely handled by Mr. Musk himself, who writes his own tweets and blog posts. Last Monday, he answered questions on social news forum Reddit Inc., telling readers about a favorite Winston Churchill quote about surmounting adversity: \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d\n\nIn the legal department, Tesla went through three general counsels from 2009 to 2012. It then had no general counsel for more than two years until Mr. Musk promoted his former divorce lawyer, Todd Maron.\n\nMr. Maron had been Tesla\u2019s deputy general counsel. Mr. Musk says the turnover was an aberration, noting that SpaceX has had the same chief counsel for a decade.\n\nLast spring, Tesla pushed out its sales chief in Europe shortly after the company started selling cars there. An executive overseeing Japan and Hong Kong was let go last summer.\n\n\nGeorge Blankenship, the former Apple Inc. executive who came up with Tesla\u2019s slick retail-store concept, left Tesla in 2013 after his responsibilities were scaled back. He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nTesla\u2019s chief engineer quit months before the Model S sedan was launched, while Mr. Musk fired the chief chassis engineer working on the Model X sport-utility vehicle, saying at the time that he asked for the resignation because \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a good fit for him.\u201d Tesla shares fell 17% after the auto maker announced the two departures but then rebounded.\n\nSeveral people at Tesla say Mr. Musk has looked on and off for years for a chief operating officer who would be the auto maker\u2019s second-highest executive. Outsiders approached by Mr. Musk include Andy Palmer, the former chief planning officer at Nissan Motor Co. who left the Japanese auto maker in September to become CEO of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., a person familiar with the matter says.\n\nTesla technology chief JB Straubel, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen, business-development chief Diarmuid O\u2019Connell and finance chief Deepak Ahuja have been at Tesla for at least five years and are considered close to Mr. Musk.\n\nBut none of them is seen as likely to succeed him. Mr. Musk has indicated that he will stay in the top job for at least four or five more years.\n\nTesla often spurns job candidates who have \u201ctoo much automotive experience,\u201d says someone recently recruited by the company. During an interview, the person was told that Tesla considered it a major negative to have extensive GM experience on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Tesla didn\u2019t offer the person a job.\n\nPeople who have worked at Tesla say Mr. Musk\u2019s ambition and vision are inspiring. But the hard-charging culture can be exhausting, they say.\n\nBrett Foster, a former Tesla engineer who redesigned faulty retractable door handles on the Model S, recalls a profanity-laced email in mid-2013 in which Mr. Musk prodded managers to soften their communications with lower-level employees. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t be an a\u2014\u2019 was the gist of it,\u201d Mr. Foster says. \u201cI actually kind of liked that he did it.\u201d\n\nSome managers tried to emulate Mr. Musk\u2019s never-say-no style, but \u201cwithout being as smart as Elon,\u201d says Mr. Foster, who didn\u2019t interact with the CEO regularly. \u201cI struggled with the culture and am extremely happy I am no longer there.\u201d He now works at Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nRyan Popple, Tesla\u2019s finance chief from 2008 to 2010, says Mr. Musk\u2019s relentless perfectionism has steered Tesla to where it is today. Mr. Popple, now the chief executive of electric bus makerProterra Inc., remembers when Mr. Musk demanded that Tesla figure out how to make aluminum body panels for the Model S, rather than hire an outside supplier to do the job.\n\nThe process is highly technical, tricky and expensive. \u201cHe was the only person in the room who thought it was a good idea,\u201d says Mr. Popple. \u201cThere were a lot of people, including me, who thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know how this is going to work.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Musk responded: \u201cWe have to own it.\u201d\n\nTesla now makes all the aluminum body panels it needs in its own factory.\n\nWrite to Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com",

He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla\u2019s chief engineer quit months before the Model S sedan was launched, while Mr. Musk fired the chief chassis engineer working on the Model X sport-utility vehicle, saying at the time that he asked for the resignation because \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a good fit for him.\u201d Tesla shares fell 17% after the auto maker announced the two departures but then rebounded.</p>\n\n<p>Several people at Tesla say Mr. Musk has looked on and off for years for a chief operating officer who would be the auto maker\u2019s second-highest executive. Outsiders approached by Mr. Musk include Andy Palmer, the former chief planning officer at Nissan Motor Co. who left the Japanese auto maker in September to become CEO of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., a person familiar with the matter says.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla technology chief JB Straubel, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen, business-development chief Diarmuid O\u2019Connell and finance chief Deepak Ahuja have been at Tesla for at least five years and are considered close to Mr. Musk.</p>\n\n<p>But none of them is seen as likely to succeed him. Mr. Musk has indicated that he will stay in the top job for at least four or five more years.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla often spurns job candidates who have \u201ctoo much automotive experience,\u201d says someone recently recruited by the company. During an interview, the person was told that Tesla considered it a major negative to have extensive GM experience on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Tesla didn\u2019t offer the person a job.</p>\n\n<p>People who have worked at Tesla say Mr. Musk\u2019s ambition and vision are inspiring. But the hard-charging culture can be exhausting, they say.</p>\n\n<p>Brett Foster, a former Tesla engineer who redesigned faulty retractable door handles on the Model S, recalls a profanity-laced email in mid-2013 in which Mr. Musk prodded managers to soften their communications with lower-level employees. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t be an a\u2014\u2019 was the gist of it,\u201d Mr. Foster says. \u201cI actually kind of liked that he did it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Some managers tried to emulate Mr. Musk\u2019s never-say-no style, but \u201cwithout being as smart as Elon,\u201d says Mr. Foster, who didn\u2019t interact with the CEO regularly. \u201cI struggled with the culture and am extremely happy I am no longer there.\u201d He now works at Samsung Electronics Co.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Popple, Tesla\u2019s finance chief from 2008 to 2010, says Mr. Musk\u2019s relentless perfectionism has steered Tesla to where it is today. Mr. Popple, now the chief executive of electric bus makerProterra Inc., remembers when Mr. Musk demanded that Tesla figure out how to make aluminum body panels for the Model S, rather than hire an outside supplier to do the job.</p>\n\n<p>The process is highly technical, tricky and expensive. \u201cHe was the only person in the room who thought it was a good idea,\u201d says Mr. Popple. \u201cThere were a lot of people, including me, who thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know how this is going to work.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Musk responded: \u201cWe have to own it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tesla now makes all the aluminum body panels it needs in its own factory.</p>\n\n<p>Write to Mike Ramsey at <a href=\"mailto:michael.ramsey@wsj.com\">michael.ramsey@wsj.com</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
