  "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago I walked into the local Audi dealership. There was a used 2013 A5 that my wife wanted to me look at, however, it had sold the night before we showed up.\n\nSo I test drove a used 2013 A4. It was alright, and to be honest, not too different from the 2014 Acura TSX I had just finished test driving. Since they didn't have any more late model used cars, I drove a new A5 coupe. Completely different feel from the A4. Especially considering that I've been driving a coupe for the past 12 years, it drove very nice.\n\nSo just for the hell of it, I asked to drive an S5. Wow. Long story short, I end up leaving with the S5 that was parked in the show room. Never intended buying a new car, but was definitely impressed all around.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/cZ1Q0",
