Andre Johnson? Calvin Johnson? Stevie Johnson?\n\nAnd Thomas? You must mean Julius Thomas. Or was it Pierre Thomas? Or... Demaryius Thomas?\n\nI get that it's fun to use fantasy jargon, but please use distinguishable nicknames (Megatron/CJ2K/Brees/Roddy/PFM) and not highly generic lastnames used by multiple fantasy starters, sometimes even on the same team. It really helps reduce confusion.  Thanks!\n",
