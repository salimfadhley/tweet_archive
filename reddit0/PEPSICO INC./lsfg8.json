  "selftext": "Hi Reddit!\n\n*Hi, Chris*\n\nI recently quit my job as a web software programmer to go \"full-time freelance,\" and am looking to take on new clients.\n\nI'm a full-stack web developer: Front end (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and back-end (PHP, MySQL, LAMP setup & configuration).\n\nI pride myself in using the latest standards (HTML5 and CSS3) and fanciest toys (JavaScript animations, lightboxes, etc), but responsibly and appropriately. I'm not a designer, but I'm proficient with Photoshop and Illustrator enough to take your PSD or AI file and generate hand-crafted code from it.\n\nSome of my clients include PepsiCo, Buffets Inc, PureVia sweetener, Wisk detergent and Schweigert Meats - but don't let the size of those companies scare you off! My rates are very reasonable and I'm willing to work with any size organization or company.\n\nHere's my [portfolio site](http://chrisgaraffa.com), which has a link to my resume. To get in touch, feel free to email me via the link on my website, or send a PM here on Reddit.",
