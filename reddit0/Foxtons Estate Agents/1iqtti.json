They work hard for their A-levels, study furiously at university and emerge with a decent 2:1, only to be told that if they are lucky they might be able to get a job steam-cleaning fat from London\u2019s sewers or working as an estate agent in Fulham. </p>\n\n<p>As the father of three teenage children I spend many hours chewing the end of a Biro, wondering what might be done about this. And I think I have a suggestion: rather than settling for a dreary job flogging crappy flats, school-leavers should be encouraged to take up a life of crime. </p>\n\n<p>In the olden days this would not have worked at all because you\u2019d soon be caught by Mr Dixon or beaten up by Jack Regan. And then you\u2019d appear in front of a red-faced beak, who\u2019d give you a damn good talking-to before sending you to prison. Now, though, things are a bit different... </p>\n\n<p>Today, because the police devote approximately 90% of their resources to phone hacking and disc jockeys who are already dead, they have had to get fairly radical when it comes to investigating burglary and acts of extreme violence. </p>\n\n<p>Mostly this involves not investigating them at all. And as a result of that, three out of every four crimes committed in this country remain unsolved. </p>\n\n<p>So instead of applying for a job with Foxtons, why not hold up a post office? Provided you don\u2019t leave your name and address on the counter, or stare into the CCTV camera for too long, or light a cigarette while you\u2019re waiting for the postmistress to put the cash in a bag, there is a 75% chance you will get away with it. </p>\n\n<p>And even if you don\u2019t, there\u2019s no need to worry. Because the police now spend so much time working out who listened to Sienna Miller\u2019s voicemails, they really don\u2019t have the resources to process your pesky robbery. So they have devised a cunning way of letting you go. </p>\n\n<p>Today crims are regularly dealt with using what\u2019s called a \u201ccommunity resolution\u201d, which is as weak and as lentilly as it sounds. The offender is simply made to say to sorry to his victim and in return he will not get a criminal record. In the past 12 months more than 30,000 people have been dealt with in this way. They\u2019ve kicked someone\u2019s head in. And after saying \u201csorry\u201d, they\u2019ve gone home to bed. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you shoot the postmistress in the head with a sawn-off shotgun, they will put a couple of bobbies on the case, and if they find you, they won\u2019t be able to make you say sorry to the victim. Because she\u2019ll be spattered all over the Benson &amp; Hedges and the lottery ticket dispenser. </p>\n\n<p>This means you will go to court and you may be given a life sentence. But again, there\u2019s no need to worry unduly. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d estimate that today 75% of the population would say a life sentence is the right punishment for shooting a postmistress in the head, while 24.9 % would say you should be hanged. And that leaves 0.1% who\u2019d say you should be sent to live in a cottage at the seaside. And luckily for you the 0.1% are judges who sit in the Grand Chamber, the highest echelon of the European Court of Human Rights. </p>\n\n<p>Last week they decided that it is inhumane to lock up Jeremy Bamber \u2014 a man who killed his entire family \u2014 for life and that he must be allowed to seek parole. They agreed with his claim that the time he\u2019d served already had left him depressed and in despair. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that he and the other 48 people currently serving whole-life sentences in England and Wales \u2014 Rose West is one of them, and Peter Sutcliffe is another \u2014 will actually get parole; only that they can apply for it. And this may put you off the idea of a life of crime. But don\u2019t be disheartened, because if you try to escape, there\u2019s really not much anyone can do to stop you. </p>\n\n<p>Last week we heard about a chap called Jimmy Mubenga. After he had served two years in Britain for actual bodily harm, the authorities decided it\u2019d be best if he spent the rest of his life in Angola and issued a deportation order. But, sadly, when the plane landed in Africa, he was all dead. </p>\n\n<p>Guards from the private security firm G4S said that Mubenga had tried to attack one of them on the trip and that they\u2019d had to restrain him. But last week an inquest jury in Isleworth, west London, decided he\u2019d been unlawfully killed. So the guards will probably face charges, which means G4S will doubtless return to its original policy of simply letting prisoners wander off, willy-nilly. </p>\n\n<p>Add all this together and it\u2019s easy to see why crime is a sensible option for today\u2019s school-leavers. </p>\n\n<p>Except for one thing. The reason why people choose to earn a living by chiselling fat from a rat-infested, foul-smelling sewer rather than shooting postmistresses in the head is that they have a moral compass. They know that even if they ended up, scot-free, in a villa in Spain, they would never be happy again. </p>\n\n<p>And that\u2019s what the system seems to have forgotten: that West and Bamber and all the others who are currently serving life aren\u2019t wired up like ordinary people. They\u2019re odd. Weird. Dangerous. We may like to think that with help they can reboot their inner workings, but it\u2019s most likely they can\u2019t. Which is why, for them, life has to mean life. </p>\n\n<p>Let me put it to you this way. I know people who have not touched a drop of alcohol for 30 years. It is easy to assume that after all that time and all that hardship, they must be able to drink socially and occasionally like normal people. But they daren\u2019t even have a mouthful of sherry trifle, because they know that once you\u2019ve become an alcoholic, you are an alcoholic for life. And you have to pay the price.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
