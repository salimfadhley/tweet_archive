  "selftext": "First off I want to thank everyone who takes the time to read this post and write a response. Your time is valuable and I appreciate it. \n\nNext I'd like too give a little about my education and work history. I was home-schooled through grade school, got excelled marks on my standardized tests, and was accepted into colleges' honors programs with academic scholarships. I chose a state university and chose class a curriculum that would hopefully lead me into the field of genetics. I took an assistant job in the biology research lab, and was prepared to take on the world. In my second semester, Chemistry II slapped that idea to the ground, my gpa suffered and I no longer qualified to be in the honors program, but otherwise I was able to get my science pre-reqs out of the way.\n\nNo worries, the honors-only entrepreneurship class made me realize I only wanted to get into genetics so I could one day direct futuristic research labs anyway. I changed my major to communications with a minor in business focusing on marketing (In hindsight I see that I should have switched my major to general business and done discovery courses, but I'm bad at asking for help from my advisers). \n\nMy communications and marketing classes were a breeze, I had joined a Fraternity, and I was able to spend most of my time socializing. That all changed when I took an intro to world politics class taught by a seasoned war vet. Suddenly my paltry marketing quizzes became 30+ page, single spaced essays and hundreds of pages of reading. By the end of my Junior year I had switched my major to Political Science focusing on classes in international political economics. I dreamed of working for Goldman Sachs or a hedge fund, managing multinational firms and millions in assets, jet setting the globe.\n\nIn this time I assisted in starting a local humanitarian non-profit (which has been very successful and I now sit on the board), I obtained two internships in marketing, one at a popular regional music hall and the second at a crowd sourcing design start up, and I performed freelance marketing services for multiple small business (primarily through social media).\n\nBecause I was financing my own education, because I was feeling under a lot of pressure, and because I was still behind on degree credits; I took a year off. I worked as a server, continued my freelance work, stayed involved at the non-profit and thought about what to do next. Finally in the Fall of 2013 I graduated with a BA in Political Science and quickly found a part-time job at an international humanitarian aid office doing marketing. Because of the take-home pay at that job, I also worked in sales at a hip new vapor shop on campus.\n\nOut of the blue I met a woman who had just started a one-woman consulting business for small clients, was looking for someone with my talents, and wanted me to start right away. Cut me a check for two weeks pay on the spot. I eagerly hopped on board and left my other jobs without doing my due-diligence and getting the right paperwork in order. I got caught up in her extravagant Rolodex. For one reason or another we dissolved our arrangement, with me feeling like I had not been fully recompensed. C'est la vie.\n\nWith all that being said, I still like the idea of jet setting and having lots of assets at my disposal. I'd like to eventually run entrepreneurial projects from the small scale in the arts to the large scale in technology and philanthropy. People like Richard Branson and Elon Musk inspire me. I read the economist, Inc, and The New Yorker, I listen daily to podcasts on current events, I have a strong interest in international business and politics, finance and investment, arts and culture, emerging markets and technology. I could see myself working for an investment firm or fund, a think tank, or any multinational.\n\nSince January I have been doing \"extremely well,\" as a GNC Salesperson, according to my manager. I have entertained the idea of doing sales as a career in the past, but foolishly thought I needed something that challenged me more. I was listening to a guest on Bloomberg's Masters In Business podcast who said his life turned around after he did the job he was well suited for, rather than going after the \"sexy\" job. I have been earning my own money since I was 16 and have years of customer service and sales experience under my belt. Perhaps sales and account management is the path for me?\n",
