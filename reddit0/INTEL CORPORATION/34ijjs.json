  "selftext": "Hi again, Reddit!\n\nI ran my first AMA in **[September 2012]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zz1rg/iama_academic_who_studies_what_why_and_how_people/)** just after co-authoring what has become one of the most cited pieces of literature about educational gaming (**[Our Princess Is In Another Castle: A Review of Trends in Serious Gaming for Education]( http://www.jenjenson.com/courses/learninggame/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/princessreviewseriousgames.pdf)**), and I decided it was high time I revisited the community to share what my colleagues and I have been up to for the last three years! Most recently, I\u2019ve written, published, and presented on the educational affordances of storytelling and three chief levels of narrative (i.e., Narrative-as-Designed, Narrative-as-Perceived, and Narrative-as-Social Organizer).\n\nIn the way of background: I\u2019m a Game Design Scientist at the University of Connecticut (**[here\u2019s some proof!](https://twitter.com/steveslota/status/594131403450748928)**) and a co-founder/manager of an educational game development company, **[The Pericles Group, LLC]( http://www.practomime.com/)**. I\u2019ve worked on a variety of game and instructional design projects with organizations including Arizona State University's **[Center for Games & Impact]( http://gamesandimpact.org/)**, Intel Corporation, and Pfizer, and I\u2019m in the process of co-editing a book about video games as learning ecologies. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, gaming, hiking, graphic design, playing with LEGOs, discussing the inner workings of human consciousness, and taming velociraptors.\n\nAs of last night, my colleagues and I have launched a **[Kickstarter]( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tpg/verba-espanol-a-spanish-language-card-game)** for our latest language learning game, **[VERBA]( http://www.practomime.com/content/verba.php)**, which comes in three flavors: Latin, English, and Espa\u00f1ol. The game plays much like Cards Against Humanity or Mad Libs but is driven by the common verb and noun usage in the target language. While it\u2019s primarily tailored for language classrooms, we\u2019ve found it\u2019s also great for family game nights! If you\u2019re willing and able, we\u2019d love to have you join the campaign by donating or sharing the link across social media!\n\nAnd now, whether it\u2019s about games, storytelling, or human cognition, feel free to AMA!",
