  "selftext": "My work wants to include an article about my weight loss while on Keto in the next newsletter. Typically, these articles cover those that have used low fat diets so I am already fighting an uphill battle in teaching others about this diet.\n\nCan you all critique the info that has been included regarding the diet and make sure that I have not forgotten to mention anything critical?\n\nI have removed names and other details from the article text below:\n\nLike many of us, \"Sally\" considers her high school days as the last time she was at an \u201cideal\u201d weight. Since then, she has tried protein shakes and the Atkins diet for a few months at a time, but would fall off. She admits that she hadn\u2019t done the necessary research to learn about meal planning, so would often resort to easy staples like pickles, cheese and lunch meat, of which she quickly grew tired. \n\n\nThen in June 2012, \"Sally\" and her husband began Keto (or Ketosis), which forces your body to use fat (or ketones) instead of carbs for energy. (Keto should not be confused with Ketoacidosis, a pathological metabolic state marked by extreme and uncontrolled ketosis in which the body fails to adequately regulate ketone production causing such a severe accumulation of keto acids that the pH of the blood is substantially decreased.) \n\nWith the Keto diet, which \"Sally\" took the time to research before starting, carbs are limited to about 20g a day, depending on your own body, and most of these come from vegetables, especially dark leafy greens. About 60% of your daily calories should come from mostly healthy fats, 30-35% from protein, and the rest from carbs. Bread and other flours can be substituted with flaxseed or almond meal. Sugar must be kept to a limit as well, including fruits. \"Sally\" points out that it\u2019s more important to get her carbs and fiber from veggies instead. In addition, she takes a daily multivitamin. \n\nA typical menu for someone on Keto includes a breakfast quiche made with meat and cheese and heavy whipping cream to increase the fat content. Lunch and dinner consists of a protein (hamburger patty or chicken breast) with cheese and a vegetable cooked in butter. Note that the cheese and butter are full fat; \"Sally\" does not buy anything that is low fat or fat free. Snacks might include cheese and pepperoni or raw almonds, but one is rarely hungry between Keto meals. \n\n\nKeto dieters must consume a lot of water. While most people are encouraged to drink about 64 oz. of water each day, \"Sally\" aims for 90-100 oz., since she is less likely to retain water being on Keto. \n\"Sally\" knows that what we eat is only part of the healthy weight equation, so she and her husband exercise daily as well. They alternate body weight fitness one day\u2014push-ups, lunges, squats\u2014with cardio the next\u2014walking, rollerblading, street hockey. \n\n\nSince starting Keto just over a year ago, coupled with regular exercise, \"Sally\" has lost 82 pounds, while her husband has shed 80! Other benefits include increased energy levels, even after lunch, when \"Sally\" used to feel sluggish and experience headaches. Her cholesterol has come down from 270 to 202, her triglycerides being at their lowest level ever.\n\nThanks all for your help!",
