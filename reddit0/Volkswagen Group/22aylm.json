I went for a 1990 (89 built) Vw Corrado G60 with a ton of brandnew parts and tons of extras and spare parts included it even says \"Made in WEST Germany\" which I find uber cool. It's been really well kept for the most part there's just minor TLC stuff here and there. Feel free to ask questions or just enjoy the pics! :)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z4pEQD2.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jTZeW5n.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EaGAScX.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uaUp9pj.jpg\nhttp://imgur.com/1QlYu05.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bbFqvqN.jpg",
