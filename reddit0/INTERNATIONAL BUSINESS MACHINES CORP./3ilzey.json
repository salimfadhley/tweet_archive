We work at IBM and like to talk about app infrastructure, app delivery and app tool projects (some of our favorite projects: PureApp, Bluemix, WebSphere, Urban Code and WAS Liberty). We're going to answer tech questions virtually in this Reddit AMA at 12:00pm EST and in real life at DeveloperConnect. Feel free to ask us anything you want! \n\nParticipating Panelists:\nRam Vennam -- Bluemix Developer Advocate /\nSteve A. Mirman -- WebSphere & Mobility SWAT Team - East IMT /\nRichard Irving -- Certified IT Specialist /\nJoshua Carr -- Technical Liaison, IBM Developer Outreach \n\nCheck here for our proof and additional info: http://ibm.co/1hlPW1D\n\nEDIT 1: Thanks for all the great questions everyone! We had a ton of fun answering them. We're wrapping up now, time to get back to our day jobs. You can find most of us on our twitter handle @IBMWebSphere. We\u2019ll also be attending and speaking at Developer Connect (http://ibm.co/1JoAefe), if you\u2019d like to come see us in person!  \n\nEDIT 2: I (~Joshua) have gone to bed as it's now 1AM, it's been really fun to chat here. I appreciate all the comments and questions, even the ones about lotus notes! Goodnight. ",
