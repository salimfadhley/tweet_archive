  "selftext": "Hello fellow eve redditors.\n\nMy corp and I have a small problem and that problem is a high-sec war dec. Now to most of you this might not be a problem but hear me out below are the details.\n\nThe war dec was by a small corp that seem to do this all the time as they have a couple of active wars and several completed ones. Now most don't go on too long (couple of weeks). The corp we are fighting is only a couple of active members and is mainly in dodoxie but the main protagonist of the war is a sneaky guy and refuses to fight fair.\n\nNow when talking to former and current war targets his tactics became apparent. He has allies in non War target corps who show up in neutral logi ships, he is normally in a hurricane or a cynabal.\n\nyou can see our problem. He is sneaky. We cant jsut go right into the logi's as they are not part of the war and would involve getting concorded, If we try to take him down the spider tanking group of logis keep him and the rest of them up untill everyone is dead. \n\nI am sure i can get numbers (how many i don't know) but another problem is that he clearly doesn't want to fight fair so as far as I can tell if we have the strength to beat him, he is going to either wuss out and run or just batphone more help and then destroy us. In my corp currently there are not enough people to mount a proper fight as we are small and a few of us are miners so are unable to really fit for PvP. \n\nMy question to all of you is what should my corp and I do about this menace that really needs to be taught a lessone",
