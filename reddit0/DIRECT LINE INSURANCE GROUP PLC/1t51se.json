However, over the last couple of years their appetite has been getting stricter and their prices have been getting significantly larger.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m considering dropping Travelers, and picking up 2-3 carriers to serve my current commercial book. With a better appetite and more competitive pricing I should be able to increase the book much more easily as well.  </p>\n\n<p>As such, I&#39;m looking for advice on some good carriers to pick up to serve this book.
