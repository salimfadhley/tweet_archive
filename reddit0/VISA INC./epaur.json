I work in sports Marketing and Event Management, so if anyone has any contacts or can point me towards a somewhere that might be useful, that would be much appreciated.\n\nWe also probably need some accommodation advice, but I've not got to that stage yet... We get put in a place for a couple of weeks when we arrive, but after that we're on our own.\n\nIt's all a bit hectic at the moment, as we're trying to plan a move whilst tieing up all our loose ends over in London....\n\nOnce we've settled in, I'd be more than happy to share a cup of tea with some friendly redditors in exchange for a bit of help in advance!\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
