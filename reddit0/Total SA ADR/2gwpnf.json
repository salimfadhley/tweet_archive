WHY!?...\nI thought the glow was the mere absence of the addiction? Unfortunately it is not so.\nAfter a lot of observational force, here is what I think are the components of the glow:\n\n\n\n\n1. Energy = A hormonal cocktail of, among other DA/ADR/T*\n  + Has a use it or lose it mechanism.\n  + When stimulated, it returns. If not, no return. It's like the body adapts to the hormonal \"output\". This will explain why you get powers in the first place in a minute.\n  + You can easily recognize the UoL mechanism if you've ever started regular running or weight lifting. The first time, it's draining. A couple of days after you've missed your scheduled workout, you're suddenly energized!\n  + Sex returns with MASSIVE energy. Makes sense, the biggest natural stimulant should be libido.\n  + This can be stimulated not only by sexuality but by anything that energizes you or stimulates DA . E.g work and especially training.****\n\n\n2. DA \"availability\" (which includes:)\n   + No hyperstimulation (= any stimulation that skips a the NATURAL refractory period)\n             - Porn & drugs are artificial stimulants that skips RP. Don't consume with reliance on your natural desires\n             - Sex & apples are natural stimulants. Knock yourself out. Your brain is safe.\n   + Correct DA response\n              - DA response wired to the specific stimulant you want to have a high from. You must first have the DA resp. wired to X. And then do X to expect a flow experience (which characterize DA)\n              - In our case: Socialization is the stimulant\n              - DA response gets wired to something simply by doing it and not rewire to something else more potent (like porn), before you do it again.***\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nQ: You're being unclear. Why did I get glow when I stopped watching porn!?\n\nA: Component# 2 is precisely what you fixed when you stopped watching porn. You cut out hyperstimulation and you wired your brain to release DA when you socialize instead of fapping. The first weeks into NoFap, the energy (in this case from libido) has been stimulated from regular fapping, and is returning in VAST quantities. As soon as the DA response have adjusted to socializing (you've skipped a number of scheduled porn sessions), you will feel that superhuman feeling when socializing. The energy from all that porn is so powerful that you'll glow all the time! However, after some time, although DA response is good, the libido has diminished (because you've neither had sex nor masturbated (UoL)!) and that is why everything feels \"normal\" again. The glow has vanished.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: So what do I do to get the glow back?\n\nA: Sum-up:    Glow = DA availability + high energy   (+ DA stimulation)\n\nBecause you have stopped watching porn, this can be simplified. \n\n - Hyperstimulation is out of the picture. Hopefully.\n\n - DA stimulation should be balanced. Hopefully you don't have a job where you don't socialize all day. Binge on as many natural DA activities as you'd like!\n\n - DA wiring is ok. You've socialized. First day it was kind of weird. Then it was completely enjoyable (the glow)\n\n\nWhat's left is:       Glow = Correct DA response + energy\n\n\nEither you take the unsafe route: You heavily binge on porn for a day or over the course of a couple of days. And then stop and socialize A LOT. If you're going to give this a try, be sure to share your experience! Expect a lot of SA the first day of socialization (as well as a lot of awesomeness a number of days after)\nBeware: \"a number of days\" vary depending on your rewiring process, I don't recommend this to you guys who are addicted. Get rid of the addiction first.\n\nSafe route: Instead of hyperstimulating, just stimulate. You'll get a far less powerful glow but you don't have to deal with the risk of relapsing, and you'll have to deal with less initial awkwardness. (Although if you have a somewhat busy and social lifestyle and is porn-free for a year, I don't think those things are worrisome).\nSo you simply put the UoL to use. Everything that drains your energy, force yourself through it today. You'll get a return the day after tomorrow (again: varies).\n\ne.g: When I used to work a lot, I stimulated my energy through work. However, what I found is a much more powerful stimulant is libido:\n\n- Either have sex (Best option, reinforces correct DA response on the go.)\n\n- Masturbate w/o porn (...maybe 3 times in a day... Then re-wire DA to socializing manually by forced socialization).\n\nThe more frequent masturbation (/natural stimulation), the more hormonal output the body adapts to, the higher energy after stopping and proper wiring (I've done this multiple times).*****\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHINGS I CUT OUT TO MAKE THE ABOVE MORE SIMPLE AND READABLE: (no need to read if you get the above)\n\n*****What does stopping mean? When should the hormones manifest?\nWhat I mean by \"The hormones adapts to the frequency\" is that if you for e.g. masturbate every other day. Your body produces energy to be able to masturbate every other day. If you want to stop. You must wait as a minimum of 2 days. Only than will the body have \"excess\" of the energy because it wasn't used.\n\nThe variable here is that you use your energy for other stuff than just masturbating. So it will, by all probability, take more than those 2 days. Just wait and you will gradually get a dose of energy every day, the magnitude depending on how frequent you masturbated. When it's all used up, you will notice. Start over. If it's not potent enough for your satisfaction, consider the unsafe route. Alternatively try a very high frequency for one full day and then forcing socialization the next week.\n\nBeware: Maintaining a frequent rate may seem unharmful but don't fall into the trap of addiction like once did. It's far less potent than porn but if you very frequently masturbate in the same environment every time, and you're near that environment all the time, it may take a bit of will-power to quit.\n\nIt doesn't have to be sex. It can simply be making out or anything that gets your engine running.\nJust to be clear. The types of DA activities that are \"energy stimulants\" are the ones who are intense/draining of energy. Obvious and best examples are libido (ejaculation) and running which have RP and both fit in to that description. (After running and ejaculation, opiods are released which dampens DA). Extra read: \"Studies: exercise increases DAr\": http://www.reuniting.info/node/7200\n\n*Whether it's DAr or DA itself is irrelevant. It's the total effects that counts and that is what I have observed, obviously.\n\nDA = Dopamine\n\nDAr = Dopamine receptors\n\nADR = Adrenaline (epinephrine in US)\n\nT = Testosterone\n\nSA = Social anxiety or Status anxiety. Most of us have Status anxiety or mild Social anxiety.\n\n\n****Side note: If you're a follower of RSD or Elliott Hulse, you may have read \"Think and grow rich\" by Napoleon Hill. Remember sex transmutation? It's the same concept. He implies that you should stop masturbating, and then put the energy you get on your work. He calls it a transmutation of sex energy.\n\n***Side note: This movement is created mainly because you've wired your DA response to your screen and never get out of it. Also, here is where social anxiety has hidden itself: When you socialize with a shortage of DA, you experience SA.\n\nI feel the following examples very clearly. If you are aware of this, I think you'll do too.\nE.g. If I don't listen to music or exercise for two weeks while doing other DA stuff. The first time I'd do them, even if I'd have energy, there would be no flow.\n\nMost prominent example: If I masturbate to porn now. I would find it very disturbing. I would not be aroused but I would ejaculate. The second time and there on after would not be so. I would start to feel a desire it. My DA wiring would then have adapted. (As you know, DA = desire) (Anyone masturbated to porn after full recovery?)\nAgain if you're a follower of RSD. This is what Tyler means when he says that you can't sleep and you literally can feel your brain rewiring at night\n\n** (+ A big fat placebo which is to your advantage as soon as you're aware of this theory/model)\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: What would be the point of rebooting if this is true?\nA: Porn wires DA only to ejaculation. If you really are addicted, your mind is obsessed with the penetration of women.\nGetting rid of the addiction alleviates you from unhealthy thinking patterns, also a chunk of anxiety can be lost. \nBut then again, when fully recovered (w/o energy), you're like an 80 year old man w/o a functioning libido.\nThe socialization becomes somewhat enjoyable, but not really a high it once was. So I guess it's your choice to make. If you want the highs or if you just want to lose the excess anxiety and frustration.\n\nUltimately, this is aimed to the guys who's already experienced lethargy with long-term celibacy. If you're not one of them, try long-term celibacy for yourself, I'm sure you'll find this interesting. (You have to go through that stage first anyway to get rid of addiction)\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome changes I'd like to see in NoFap:\n- Just like the end-goal of abstaining from drugs is well-being. The end-goal of abstaining from porn should also be well-being. The end-goal shouldn't be to abstain from sexual thoughts and masturbation for life. Sexuality is beautiful as long as its natural. And well-being encompasses natural pleasures!\n\n\u00a4\u00a4\u00a4It would be such a waste if NoFap turns into NoDAHigh.\u00a4\u00a4\u00a4\n\nNatural high are good and you can't over-consume them. The key here is that: THE NATURAL HIGH DOESN'T \"DOWN-REGULATE\" DAr LIKE ARTIFICIAL ONES. http://goo.gl/U5U7Rd.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPS. I am by no means a neurochemist. I am aware that this topic is much more complex than I make it seem. Simply referring to \"DA\" should be taken with a pinch of salt. All sorts of complexity including DA subtypes , etc, are involved. That's why I'm calling it a model. I do not intend to win the nobel prize, I'm just try to understand what I am observing.\n\nHave criticism? Please tell. \n\nRelate to this, lost your glow? Do share!",
