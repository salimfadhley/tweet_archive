  "selftext": "After leaving my C5 wormhole life for a change of scenery, I decided to take upon the business of declaring war in the hope of ransoming my targets, gaining reputation and finally being a hired gun for those who would require my expertise.\n\nTo begin I first had to find targets but being in the AU TZ I had to look for the right targets who would log on when I would. I proceeded to look through Evegate for AU TZ corps who had their business around highsec. It was a mixed success with many corps advertising themselves as AU TZ had little to zero activity in the timezone. \n\nWhile sleuthing around the forums, I was on my alt mining away when I warped in on to a belt with a full fleet of miners going at it. I then made the decision to declare war on them. It was an 19 man corp and EveWho showed they were fairly active. \n\nFast forward a day later and I have the entire corporation on my watchlist with scout alts stalking their movements. With the 24hr timer up and being available to engage the targets I found a new member of their corp moving a Myrmidon from his home (rookie) system to their base of operations. He proceeded to melt under my SFI's guns.\n\nA few more days of stalking followed where I took down targets of opportunity, only a few industrial haulers. Nothing valuable. \n\nOne morning before heading to work I found a lone member online. Proceeded to run a locator on him and found out he was hauling around in a Charon. My heart started pumping hard as I logged in my main character and blitzed 15 or so jumps to him. I found him at a POCO, attempted to ransom but all he tried to do was buy time. So I blew him up. \n\nThe opposition didn't like it - the same night they camped me in station. Hurricane, Drake, Cynabal, Arbitrator and Sacrilege. My SFI wasn't going to go well against that. I sat in silence as they shitposted in local calling me names, attacked my sexuality and accused me of pedophilia. That night they demanded 500million to surrender. \n\nWhile that happened I called upon a few friends of mine to provide neutral reps while I engaged them, however they were unavailable. I waited a few days for my buddies to be available and allowed the opposition to camp me into the station. With my alt orca pilot I ferried a proteus into the station so I can pull a surprise attack on them. They thought I only had an SFI to fight in. \n\nProteus ready, with two guardians ready to provide logi. I was ready to unleash upon the Cynabal, Drake and Sacrilege on my undock. Concerned with getting kited I made sure I could scram the cynabal before he even noticed (faction point, skirmish links). I overestimated their skill - with a bit of luck on my side. Upon undocking I pointed the cynabal and as this happened I saw the character go offline. With no hardeners and not moving, the ship melted to my blasters. Sacrilege and Drake went down easily with my neutral reppers only having to supply me with a few cycles of armor. The drake attempted to deaggress but left drones on my ship, big fault on his part.\n\nAfter that battle I experienced the most hateful experience of verbal abuse. With names removed you can read all the mails in this link: \n\n[http://pastebin.com/tXjH3yPK!](http://pastebin.com/tXjH3yPK)\n\nTo stop the mails coming in I had to put on a CSPA. It was getting annoying.\n\nThe CEO of the corp then wardecced my alt's corporation. A bit of an inconvenience but then it provided me with an opportunity - no wardec bill to pay as I can sign myself up as an ally of my alt's corp.\n\nIt's now week 2 of the war and I didn't plan for it to go longer than a week. However, this endless stream of hatemail and tears has made me prolong it. \n\nTL;DR - Wardecced a corp, blew up some of their ships (2bn+ in damages), received endless hatemail from their CEO and leadership.\n\n\n\n\n",
