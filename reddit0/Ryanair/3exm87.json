I am 5 feet tall, very petite. \n\nThe only bag I have seen that can fit someone my size is the small/medium sized Osprey Farpoint 40L that also fits Ryanair's measurements BUT I have literally called every single Canadian retailer that carries Osprey and no one has it (sold out, backorders for the bag until September or January). \n\nAny other suggestions?
