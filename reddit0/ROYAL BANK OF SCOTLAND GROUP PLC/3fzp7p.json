From there, I went straight into working an industry leading digital marketing agency where I've been since - I never wanted to go to university and study I just wanted to get into the working world.\n\nSo I'm here now, having done pretty well working my way up the company. At 19, I've managed to save \u00a325,000 by saving most of my paycheck every month and I am looking advice for what to do with it. Currently, it's just sitting in my bank account (RBS) with a relatively low 0.50% interest... which isn't doing a whole lot.\n\nI'm still living at home, so the most logical option would be to invest in a property. However, I don't want to commit to something like that at such a young age. I feel investing it is too risky because I don't have any experience in investments.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated and sorry for another one of these **\"I have *x*, what should I do with it?\"**...",
