  "selftext": "Hi r/Disneyland! \n\nI have heard from a friend out in Anaheim that the Elias and Co. store in the Buena Vista Street area is selling or used to sell a brown fedora that was modeled after the one Walt Disney wore when he arrived in Hollywood in 1923. Does anyone know if the hat is still in stock or if it has been discontinued? \n\nA big thanks to anyone who can contribute!\n\nEDIT: I am so surprised by how this thread took off. I was half-expecting people to just ignore the post and call me crazy. Thank to everyone who has given me info and made suggestions! I will just have to check back after the holiday season :) Have a magical night!",
