Also not sure if this is the best place to post this.\n\n\nLast night at about 3:15am EST (about 1 hour after i plugged it in and went to sleep) I was awoken by a loud noise and a weird squeaking sound. (I charge my phone while I'm sleeping on my bed right next to me)\n\n\nSo, I woke up, and saw a ton of smoke coming out of my phone -- it also smelled REALLY bad. Half asleep, I jumped out of bed and turned the light on, only to see that my phone was just beginning to go on fire. I dumped a glass of water I had in the room on it to stop it from burning...then woke up my brother to come help.\nThe smoke smelled so bad and wafted through the entire second floor of my house. I had a foam mattress pillow top that had a hole burned through it too--which we later threw out because it was still burning throughout. Also, some of the plastic on my phone was melting and kind of shooting out of it, and some landed on my pinky finger and burned some skin off (very small burn though).\n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions what I should do? Call Verizon? Samsung? Have a lawyer call them? I'd also like to get some type of replacement phone in the meantime...\n\n\nHere are the [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/9zxZK)\n\n\nEDIT: People keep requesting pictures of the battery. [Here they are](http://imgur.com/a/FxGzj)\n\n\n**UPDATED POST** -- I have made an updated post to inform anyone who may be interested!      http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1fmpi6/update_my_samsung_galaxy_s3_exploded_last_night/",
