The driver says his machine is broken or that for some strange reason my card is not being approved.  What actions can I take if he is refusing my to take my card payment?  This has happened many times and I am kind of getting sick of it.\n\n2)  A restaurant owner recently informed me that it is illegal for a business to charge you a minimum on your credit/debit card or to charge you a credit/debit transaction fee.  (Examples:  I go to a mexican restaurant and buy $7 worth of tacos.  They say they only accept credit card if you are over $10  OR  we charge $2 for a credit card transaction.) What do I say/What can I do in this scenario to not get overcharged and still use my card? \n\nI would like to know what legs do I have to stand on in this great city :)  Thanks",
