I am happy to join you today to answer your questions as the 2014 regular season winds down and the playoff races heat up. So feel free to ask me almost anything. I will be here for 90 minutes.\n\nTwitter Proof: https://twitter.com/CFL/status/526844235207938050\n\n\nHey everyone, I only have five more minutes left to answer your questions, then I have to take off! It's municipal election night in Toronto so I have to go vote! \n\nThanks for taking the time to ask me questions. Officiating is an important part of our game. Our officials do an excellent job. We will always strive for perfection. I believe a big part of my job is communication - not only with our officials, teams, players and coaches, but with our fans and media as well. I am glad we had this opportunity. I look forward to seeing you on the road to the 102nd Grey Cup in Vancouver. Thanks for being the best fans in sports.",
