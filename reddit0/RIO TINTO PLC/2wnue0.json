Reading Star Citizens approach to this aspect of the game makes me almost sad. Who knows when SC is finished, and meanwhile I'm stuck with a very rudimentary approach to mining, which led me to abandon the game for the last couple of months.\n\nReading Chris Roberts introduction in the newsletter almost reads like it's a dig on E:D:\n\n>Mining presents players with a variety of challenges requiring skill and intelligence, whereas mindless repetition of a task and idle drudgery are explicitly avoided. There are no aspects of mining that allow a player to simply press a button and wait without concern for a result, or that require players to perform an action repeatedly without some element of thought and/or dexterity coming into play. \n\nFurther down he goes into details regarding the different roles on a mining ship. Even though it reads like they hired Peter Moulinoux as concept-guy, it's an interesting take on how to make mining interesting: \n\n>The scan operator is responsible for injecting remote material analysis packages (RMAPs) into nearby asteroids that, upon success, immediately begin sending telemetry data back to the pilot and scan operator informing them as to the asteroid\u2019s precise material composition. Depending upon the ship and its associated hardware, anywhere from several dozen to hundreds of RMAP-equipped manually guided missiles may reside upon a mining vessel.\n\n>Upon selection of an asteroid, the center of mass is automatically calculated and the scan operator begins the process of gradually scanning for a suitable RMAP insertion point. This is a multi-faceted process involving a search for a section of surface geometry oriented such that its perpendicular traverses the center of mass or somewhere close to it. The operator receives feedback on the angular difference, but it\u2019s ultimately their call as to whether a given site is good enough or not.\n\nSo what's going on with mining in Elite Dangerous? Is it too late to hope some of what Chris Roberts are writing will be found in E:D as well?\n\nI hope so, cause I fear the SC will be way too complex for me when it finally arrives, probably years from now.",
