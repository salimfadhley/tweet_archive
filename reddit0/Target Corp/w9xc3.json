Lately I've been scouting out targets for corp mates and when I set a bookmark of a wreck and ask for them to warp in, they can't seem to see the bookmark.  Sometimes jumping out of system and back in will let them see it.  Most times if I set the bookmark before they are in system, it will be there once they jump in.  Is there a set mechanic for this, like it takes 10 minutes to show up, or you have to reload the system to see it?",
