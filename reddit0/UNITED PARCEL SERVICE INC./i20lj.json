It's a great phone, and before I managed to get it I waited for it for 4 months. I love my phone.\n\nI started having problems with it at the beginning of April. Long story short, it did not want to recognize the SIM card any more, although the SIM was ok.\n\nI contacted HTC, as it was still under warranty. And this is where the nightmare begins. I live in France and was given my the customer support a UK number to call, apparently that's where service for Nexus One is being done.\n\nI spent at least 1 hour on the phone with them, distributed between 7 phone calls, that went something like this:\n\n- first guy, asks me for my details, tells me UPS will come pick up my phone. Everything OK, was feeling happy. Tells me I should be receiving an e-mail with instructions on how the delivery will be happening.\n\n- I call again, after 2 hours not receiving the e-mail. After 7-8 minute of music and waiting, I give them my name. I am put on hold and then the operator hangs up on me.\n\n- I call again, wait for another 5-6 minutes, they hang up again.\n\n- Call again, manage to get them speaking, tell them I did not receive the e-mail with the instructions. Operator tells me there was a mistake and there would be no UPS delivery and that I would have to send the phone. Remember it was me calling them, not them calling me back to announce something has changed.\n\n- Called again, don't remember why (2+ month ago...). This time the operator goes back to initial story, telling me she has sent the mail again, that I should receive it shortly. I have her recheck my e-mail address, spell it out to her twice.\n\n- Still no mail, call again. E-mail address was not spelled right (WTF???). Give them the address again and also an alternate one.\n\n\nAfter all these phone calls, I finally got an e-mail saying that they can not send e-mails to my address. Mind=blown. It gave however the instructions I needed for the UPS delivery.\n\n\n2 days later I deliver the phone. It arrives and it should have been fixed in 5-10 days (their statement). I was called around the end on that interval and was told that it would take another 20 days for the repairs. I had nothing to do but swallow it.\n\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I received an e-mail saying that my phone is going to be shipped to me. I was so happy, was not wasting my 50euro data plan much longer. Then got a voice mail on my phone saying my Desire phone will be shipped immediately.\n\n\nCalled them to ask what Desire phone they were talking about. After the standard 10minute hang up mark, I finally managed to get through to them. They took the liberty to change my phone without asking me. They had already shipped a Desire instead and were no longer repairing my phone. I told them not to do that and that I want my Nexus One repaired. They said it would take another 20 days.\n\n\nI am now still without my phone. After talking to them yesterday, they said it was ok for me to use the Desire until my phone arrived. I feel however that it is 2 little 2 late. They were, however, unable to give me an estimate on when I would be receiving my phone.\n\n\nI seriously don't want to deal with this company any more. They did not make one mistake, it would have been understandable. But they have shown repeated incompetence and unwillingness to solve my problem. \n\n\n**tl;dr** After 2+ months, I am still waiting for my phone to be repaired. Was not offered an ETA\n\n**edit** grammar ",
