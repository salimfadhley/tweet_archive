The early Tekkit series was great with the rival companies of Honeydew Inc. and Sipsco with so many great moments of their antics against each other.  I love the Blackrock series with some of the best moments involving the conflict between Rythian and Sjin/Duncan.  It also gave more opportunity to cross groups (i.e. Sjin showing up in Rythian&#39;s series)  But now there seems to be no conflict at all.  Again, I greatly enjoy watching what&#39;s been going on, seeing Duncan build crazy science stuff really encourages me to build more stuff like that on my server and Sjin&#39;s farming series is quite relaxing and almost like a Let&#39;s Build that he&#39;s playing at the same time.  I&#39;m hoping that they have something planned at some point, but I was curious what everyone else thought about conflict in the series to have some sort of loose plot.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
