Watching this programme has only made me more determined to make the transition. I feel like I've been so blind to the horrific ways our food is produced and the environmental impact it has. \nThis is one of my first posts on Reddit and although any advice is greatly appreciated as I take my first vegan steps, all I really wanted to do was share my decision with people who understand! \nThanks for listening  :) ",
