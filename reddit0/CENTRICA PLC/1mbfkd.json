Two, there&#39;s a strong chance the baby will get upset or sick at sea and may be very loud.  If you&#39;re in a bordering cabin next to these folks, good luck tuning out the wailing baby.  Three, a baby of this age is not fully vaccinated and has a weak immune system.  You&#39;re on a large vessel with close quarters for a week with potentially limited medical care.  Many cruises have had instances of norovirus and flu outbreaks.  Gee, what a great idea!</p>\n\n<p>From what I can read, all infants must be 6+ months to cruise, some 12+ months.  As someone taking off on a Caribbean cruise in January I really hope our neighbors are considerate and don&#39;t bring infants along.  Cruises and vacations in general are a place to relax and have fun.  I really wish cruise lines (maybe with the exception for Disney) would raise the age limit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
