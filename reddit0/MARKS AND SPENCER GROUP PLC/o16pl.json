  "selftext": "I am a Mathematician and a Chemistry/Physics enthusiast. My father, who was a pilot and is quite knowledgeable in the ways of physics, asked me this question:\n\nWhen a light ray travels from air to water (e.g. shining a flashlight in a glass of water), it is traveling at a velocity of 3.0 x 10^8 m/s (c in air). As soon as the light hits the water, the speed of light drops because the water absorbs the light. (c in water < c in air). Let's assume that the same light ray is reflected from the water and back to air. When the light travels back into the air, the speed of light comes back to 3.0 x 10^8 m/s (c in air). That increase in velocity requires a certain amount of energy. Where in the water is the energy coming from in order to speed the light back up to the speed of light in air?\n\nDetailed explanations are welcome. Thanks!",
