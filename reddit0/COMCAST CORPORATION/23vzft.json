You join communities like these and &quot;fight against Comcast&quot; but in reality, you aren&#39;t doing shit. Let me explain how we can bring down Comcast.\nThere are 3 things that can kill Comcast:\nLegislation, Google Fiber, and us.</p>\n\n<p>1) Legislation-\nIt isn&#39;t going to happen. You may not like it and it may make you uncomfortable, but you and I both know that politicians are paid off. What is a fortune for a congressman is chump change for Comcast. Any congressman who tries to bring down Comcast (When I say Comcast, I&#39;m referring to the merge) will simply be paid not to. Comcast is absolutely massive, and they will have no problem making sure legislation doesn&#39;t get in their way.</p>\n\n<p>2) Google fiber-\nGoogle fiber is a surefire way of destroying Comcast, but the problem is that it doesn&#39;t spread fast enough. It takes Google a LOT of time and work to get Fiber to cities, and it&#39;s going to take a long time before Google Fiber reaches enough cities to destroy Comcast.</p>\n\n<p>3) Us-\nComcast is a corporation and all corporations exist because they have money. We give them the money. When you joined this subreddit and posted &quot;I&#39;m joining the fight :D&quot;, you most likely did it through internet service that YOU pay Comcast for. We need to cut off their supply. (This sounds like a war plan, because that&#39;s exactly what it is. Two armies fighting each other). Without us, they are nothing. We need to find other Cable providers, cancel our Comcast plans, and switch to them. Don&#39;t pick one Cable company because then we&#39;ll just create another Comcast, but rather, we need to collaborate and choose a group of Cable companies to switch to. Some of us to Company A, some to B, etc. Comcast will lose their customers, and lose all of their money. This will work if enough people do it, but we need to act fast. Think back to the late 1800&#39;s when monopolies were born. How did Vanderbilt get (almost) absolute control over the railroad market? By buying out smaller companies. Same with Rockefeller and his oil, and Carnegie and his steel. And same with Comcast. Soon enough, Comcast (Still referring to the merge) will buy out everyone underneath it, and then we will truly be screwed. We&#39;ll have nowhere to go and will have to wait until Google Fiber saves us. By leaving Comcast and going to smaller companies, we are weakening Comcast, and strengthening those companies. This will prevent Comcast from buying them out and soon enough, Comcast will lose its customers and will be out of power.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you really want to kill Comcast, stop posting about it online and take action.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
