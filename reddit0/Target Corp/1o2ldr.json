  "selftext": "I'm honestly not sure if I like the idea myself, since I have alts who live in NPC corps.  Nevertheless, the idea occurred to me the other day and I want to see what other players think about it.\n\nI suppose it could work in a variety of different ways, but the idea would be for there to be an occasional war between the various (non-newbie) NPC corps.  The wars would be declared automatically, perhaps on a random basis, using the same war dec mechanics that already exist between player corps.  No NPC corp would be at war continuously, and all wars would end in 1 or 2 weeks.  I'm thinking that a given NPC corporation would spend only about 10-15% of any given year in an at-war condition, but perhaps this number should be (a bit) higher.\n\nAnyway, I can see all kinds of effects from this, good and bad.  On the plus side, it would provide new outlets for PvP in Empire space, would eliminate the near perfect safety that many take advantage of there, and would encourage players to form corporations among themselves once the primary advantage of NPC corporations (immunity from war decs) was eliminated.\n\nOn the other hand, this loss of safety could lead the most ardent and fearful carebears to leave the game altogether, and could result in thousands of tiny 1- or 2-man corps being formed.  These corps would have so few targets, and there would be so many of them, that most would avoid any real risk of being war decced.\n\nAgain, I'm not sold on this notion myself, but I am curious if anyone can point out some facets of it that I may be missing.",
