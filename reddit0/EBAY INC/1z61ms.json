It\u2019s been an exhaustive, but necessary exercise; I\u2019m a bit picky because I won\u2019t use sites that require readers to pay before they get anything useful so most of my time has been spent reading free eBooks and trying to find unique content. As a result of this research, two weeks ago I decided to concentrate a significant amount of time on a selling tip that I kept seeing pop up in almost every one of the blogs I was reviewing; when to list your auction items so that they end at the optimum time. My efforts from this two-week experiment have culminated into this article (and one more next week). </p>\n\n<p>The Rule</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to selling rules, almost every source agrees on a few general things, write descriptive titles, communicate with your buyer, take great pictures, etc., but the one that stands out to me is the \u201ccorrect\u201d time to have an item end on eBay. All but two of the almost fifty sources I looked at stated that Sunday evening was the optimum time for an auctioned item to end (assuming the average eBay user uses their downtime on Sunday evening to spend money bidding online). Even eBay Inc. suggests that sellers set up their auctions to end on their target audiences Sunday evening. For example if you\u2019re in New York and you are looking to sell to a Hong Kong buyer, list your item so that it ends on Sunday evening in HK (13 hours ahead of EST). </p>\n\n<p>Quick note for newbie\u2019s- \neBay auctions end exactly 24, 72, 120, 168, or 240 hours after you start them so if your auction lasts seven days (168 hours), you list on Sunday evening, five days (120 hours); you list on Tuesday evening, three days (72 hours); on Thursday evening, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The \u201cSunday evening rule\u201d intrigued me. For almost a decade the assumption has been that because eBays audience spikes on Sunday evenings, and more viewers equal more bidders, than items should be the most successful if they end when the most people are viewing them. In addition to eBay \u2018s data, there are dozens of successful eBay bloggers who run equally successful eBay stores that claim to abide by the Sunday rule. The problem is that no one outside of eBay, (seriously no one) has any real data to back up the rule. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, I decided to crunch the numbers and figure out if Sunday evening was really all it has been hyped up to be. Many of you may know that before I ran this blog I made artificial intelligence for derivative transactions at investment banks, so this was an awesome chance to get back to my developer roots and figure out a way to automate the scraping and analysis of 1000\u2019s of eBay listings. </p>\n\n<p>I set up two experiments, the first of which I will be talking about in this article. \nExperiment #1 targeted \u201chigh demand, high supply items.\u201d These are items where at least 500 identical versions have been sold in the last 90 days. For example between Nov. 20, 2013 and Feb. 20, 2014 there were 567 new Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5) games for PS3 sold at auction on eBay.   </p>\n\n<p>In total, I scraped three months of sold and completed listings data from 1500 eBay items (of which GTA5 was one). 70% of the items were electronics or clothing, but each main eBay category (except for entertainment memorabilia, musical instruments, real estate, specialty services and tickets) had at least 20 items represented.</p>\n\n<p>For each item, I recorded the number of completed listings, the number of sold listings, the selling price, the number of bids, the end time and the listing title (see pic of raw data). I then organized the sold listings by weekday and found the mean (average) and median selling price and bids for each day of the week. For example the average selling price of GTA5 sold on a Tuesday (for the last 12 Tuesday\u2019s) is $46.73 (as compared to Sunday where the average is ~3% less at $45.60). </p>\n\n<p>Next I took the listings and organized them into 24 groups according to what time they ended (so group 5 would be all items that sold between 5:00 AM - 5:59 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST)). Using this data, I found the mean and median selling price and bids by hour. For example, the average selling price of all GTA5 listings ending between 7AM and 7:59AM PST over the last 12 weeks is $47.11) </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I split the listings into weekday and then again into hour and recorded the mean and median selling price and bids from that data. For example, the average selling price of a new copy of GTA5 for PS3 if it sold on Thursday between 5AM and 5:59AM PST is $45.81\u2014that same game, if sold on Tuesday at 1:00 AM PST goes for about 7% more, $49.08.</p>\n\n<p>Results</p>\n\n<p>The most intriguing thing about the data was how predictable and consistent it made the eBay landscape appear. This is probably best exemplified when you compare the number of listings being sold per hour. Of the 1500 items I looked at, 1387 had at least 30% more items sold between 6:00 and 7:59 PM PST than the rest of the days\u2019 hourly average. For example there are on average 112 Black GoPro 3 cameras sold between 6:00 and 6:59 PM PST every day (compare that to 63 being sold just one hour earlier). </p>\n\n<p>Another example is the price fluctuations based on day of the week. Of the items I examined, there is not a single day of the week that offers more than a 4.6% higher average selling price than any other day. That said, for 94% of items I examined, the items selling on Sunday had either the lowest (46%) or one of the three lowest average selling prices (48%) of any day of the week (Tuesday had the highest selling price in 72% of cases followed by Thursday and Saturday). Sunday was the best day to end a sale for only 16 of the 1500 items I looked at. </p>\n\n<p>The most interesting (and useful) result was the significant gap in selling price depending on the hour the auction ended.  For example, items that ended between 6:00 and 9:00 PM PST sold for 12%-22% less than items that ended between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM PST. This is insane\u2014and is the reason why this article took so long to write because I needed to test my conclusions in real life, but the data and its analysis (tested twice because all experiments must be tested in duplicate) is solid. In fact, for most of the electronic items I analyzed, the selling price of the item (if sold at a late night auction) was only about 5% less than the retail price for that item\u2014compare that to the average discount of 20-28% off retail value for items sold at auctions ending mid-day.</p>\n\n<p>In every one of the 1500 items I analyzed, the supply of items ending very late at night (1:00-3:00 AM PST) is 90-99% less than the daily peak (6:00 to 8:00 PM PST). With that said, we can assume that late at night the supply of viewers (and buyers) is significantly less than the daily peak BUT on items where there is persistent demand (meaning all of the items I tested in this experiment), the number of buyers decreases by less than the supply of items for sale. In addition, the late night sales see 50-65% less bids than late afternoon auctions BUT the average bid increment is almost 2.5 times higher for the late night bidders; for example a new 32GB iPad Air ending at 7:00 PM PST will get 24 bids averaging $22.00 each, that same iPad will see 13 bids averaging $49.00 if it ends at 12:00AM Midnight PST. (It will also likely sell for $40 more than the 7:00PM item)</p>\n\n<p>If this data holds over time I now have an appendix of items that I can use to figure out the best day and time to list an item to realize the highest selling price. In the coming months I hope this will prove useful for my 100K challenge (especially as I move into flipping retail items where my margins are low). Once I make the data a bit more user friendly I will pop it up on the site or make a simple app to help my Gmargin subs boost their margins (but only if there is interest so please let me know below in the comments).</p>\n\n<p>Putting my data to use</p>\n\n<p>Last week I shared this data (in full) with a Gmargin member who runs a very large eBay store.
