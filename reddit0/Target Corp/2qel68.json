I guess until it gets those features, we just have to stick with [AppDeals](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.app_deals) or [AppSales](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.tsapps.appsales). Also make sure to check out [r/googleplaydeals](http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplaydeals) now and then.\n\nP.S. You guys should get [Out There](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miclos.google.games.outthere) since it is on sale! It's one of my favorite space survival games and here comes the deal: the developers announced a [Omega Edition]( http://www.geek.com/games/out-there-omega-edition-looks-stunning-even-better-than-the-original-1612014/), which is a stunning graphical overhaul of the game. It will be released in January 2015 and free for those who purchased the 3.99$ (or 0.99$, if you buy it now) original.",
