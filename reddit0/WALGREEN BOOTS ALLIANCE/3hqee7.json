  "selftext": "Dear Walgreens,\nFirst, I will not state my name or where I live. That is none of your concern. I am absolutely floored at the indecency of Walgreens. To watch hundreds of people lose their jobs from your company to be replaced by others in your Boots Alliance facade. Mr. Walgreen himself would be rolling over in his grave to have to witness such greed and disgust. I will no longer be a customer at Walgreens. I will no longer have my many prescriptions filled at Walgreens. I cannot support a company that does NOT support their own staff. To watch the hundreds in Orlando and Deerfield be ripped from dedicated, hardworking teams, is in outrage. The greed of your corporation is an abomination to this country. You should all hang your heads in shame. I will ensure you that social media will be filled with such disgust from me. I will have my entire family and friends remove their prescriptions and their shopping trips to your store. May God have mercy on all your pitiful, heartless, greedy souls.\n \nSigned \u2013 Joan of Arc\n",
