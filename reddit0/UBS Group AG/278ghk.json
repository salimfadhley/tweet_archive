Hundreds of available plans for electricity when the power all comes from the same place anyway! I found a old write up on bloomberg that mentioned this insanity, as well as an apparent scam that Goldman Sacs has run...It gets pretty technical but here&#39;s some highlights...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the decade before deregulation, Texans paid 6.4 percent less than the national average, according to the coalition. In the 10 years since, they\u2019ve paid 8.7 percent more.</p>\n\n<p>Houston-area consumers that use 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each month, enough for the average home, will pay the additional $2.39 a month for about 13 years to retire the CenterPoint debt sold Jan. 11, according to the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So anyway, read the whole article if you want to further explore the issue, here&#39;s a TL;DR: Goldman Sacs and investment firms screwed the average electrical consumer by pricing bonds too high. This meant the investors would get bigger returns, and the added cost would legally be passed on to consumers, not borne by the company. </p>\n\n<p>So when I was trying to find historical prices for electricity I found this website...<a href=\"https://centerpointenergy.secure.force.com/\">https://centerpointenergy.secure.force.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>It pulls your historical data off your meter and and analyzes different plans. This is not something the standard &quot;powertochoose&quot; website does at all. Instead you are left to examine the costs yourself comparing hundreds of different plans, with a litany of different options, different prices for over 500kwh, minimum usage fees, etc. \nThis is way better than the crappy spreadsheet I had made trying to make sense of it. Anyway, hope this helps a few of you!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://centerpointenergy.secure.force.com/\">https://centerpointenergy.secure.force.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the first half of the bloomberg write-up....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-23/consumers-hit-by-high-rates-after-deregulation.html\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-23/consumers-hit-by-high-rates-after-deregulation.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Houston consumers were supposed to get lower electricity rates from deregulation. Instead, they pay some of the nation\u2019s highest prices, partly because of bonds Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) recently sold for a local utility.</p>\n\n<p>The Wall Street bank marketed $1.7 billion of securities for Houston-based CenterPoint Energy Inc. (CNP) last month at higher yields than most of the company\u2019s similar long-term debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That raised costs borne by 2.2 million Houston-area consumers by about $47 million.</p>\n\n<p>The sale shows how deregulation in Texas backfired, driving up costs for those promised savings. Texans paid some of the lowest rates in the country before the changes, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Now they pay the fifth- highest electricity prices. The policy shift toward competition has also misfired in other states including California.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis whole thing has been tragic for ratepayers,\u201d said Thomas Brocato, a lawyer in Austin for the Gulf Coast Coalition of Cities, a group of 34 municipalities served by CenterPoint, whose share price beat the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s utilities index by about 2-to-1 in the past year. The bond issue\u2019s cost \u201cmakes it still worse,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Began in 2002</p>\n\n<p>In Texas, the second most-populous U.S. state, deregulation began with the market served by nongovernment power companies starting in 2002, a move designed to foster competition. The enabling law let utilities recover so-called stranded costs, or investments made before deregulation, from customers. For CenterPoint, that has led to $5.4 billion in bond sales.</p>\n\n<p>The policy will produce at least one more deal, a sale by an American Electric Power Co. (AEP) unit, AEP Texas Central Co. in Columbus, Ohio. The Texas Public Utility Commission on Jan. 12 said it could borrow $800 million to cover stranded costs, according to a statement from the utility. AEP serves about 1 million people in southern and western parts of the state.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the law permits the recovery of expenses made before the market changes, the commission has a duty to keep the effects on ratepayers, who cover such debt, at a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers in areas of Texas touched by deregulation pay higher electricity prices than those in other areas both in and out of state that weren\u2019t affected by changing laws, according to the Texas Coalition for Affordable Power, an advocacy group in Austin. Their rates are also higher than in other states where competition was brought to power markets, partly because of the stranded-cost recovery system, the group says.</p>\n\n<p>Policy Works</p>\n\n<p>Deregulation has worked, according to the Association of Electric Companies of Texas, an industry organization in Austin. The policy lets consumers shop for a low-price supplier, while rates are influenced by such items as the cost of power-plant fuel and the amount of capital invested in the system, said John Fainter, the group\u2019s chief executive officer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe disagree that there has been no benefit to electric consumers,\u201d said Fainter. \u201cIt\u2019s providing access to a needed service at a reasonable price.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the decade before deregulation, Texans paid 6.4 percent less than the national average, according to the coalition. In the 10 years since, they\u2019ve paid 8.7 percent more.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople in deregulated areas of Texas consistently pay higher prices,\u201d said Jake Dyer, a coalition policy analyst. \u201cThe stranded costs have increased the cost of electricity.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Historical Perspective</p>\n\n<p>For most of the history of electric power, utilities operated as monopolies with rates set by public authorities to ensure that their costs were covered and they got a \u201cfair\u201d return on invested capital, while protecting consumers from price gouging. In the 1990s, states began trying to foster competition, letting several suppliers contend for the business with a goal of improving efficiency and lowering costs.</p>\n\n<p>It hasn\u2019t always worked. Some states have pulled back while others haven\u2019t moved forward with creating competitive markets. Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), the Houston-based company that went bankrupt in 2001, manipulated power markets in California as consumers endured blackouts in 2000 and 2001, with traders bragging about \u201cstealing money from \u2018Grandma Millie,\u2019\u201d according to the California Justice Department.</p>\n\n<p>Municipalities and local taxpayers haven\u2019t always been well-served when government officials put their financial fate in the hands of Wall Street banks. In Jefferson County (3681MF), Alabama, home to Birmingham, the state\u2019s biggest city, out-of-control costs tied to sewer financing guided by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) led to the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy on record last year. County residents have shouldered rising sanitation prices and may take on more to cover the cost of related debt.</p>\n\n<p>Victimizing Cities</p>\n\n<p>For more than five years, the U.S. Justice Department has led a probe that has revealed Wall Street banks, during the same years when they were sowing the seeds of the financial crisis, were also cheating cities, states and school districts across the U.S. and using the unregulated derivatives markets to hide kickbacks paid in the schemes. About 100 municipalities in 36 states were victimized by just one of the participants, UBS AG of Zurich, which has agreed to reimburse the communities.</p>\n\n<p>In Texas, the recent CenterPoint sale\u2019s extra interest expense adds to the $1.7 billion that the utility\u2019s customers must repay for the latest sale and the $3.7 billion of such debt they already were covering. The Texas Supreme Court decided last year that the company would get to collect the extra amount, overruling the state utility commission\u2019s rejection of the cost.</p>\n\n<p>Added to Rate</p>\n\n<p>As a result, CenterPoint\u2019s ratepayers will have $2.39 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours tacked on to their monthly bills from the latest sale, the company said in a statement. They already pay $5.08 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours each month for the earlier deals.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe real tragedy is that the ratepayers are going to have to pay an extra $1.7 billion,\u201d said Brocato of the Gulf Coast Coalition.</p>\n\n<p>The situation in Houston is an example of a policy that forces consumers to cover the costs of facility investments that can\u2019t be recouped in a competitive market. About $40 billion of such debt had been sold in 12 states by July 2009, according to S&amp;P. The state utility commission\u2019s guarantee that ratepayers will cover the costs underpins S&amp;P\u2019s AAA rating on the latest CenterPoint debt issue.</p>\n\n<p>The power company, with more than 5 million metered customers around the U.S., operates a distribution utility in Houston as well as natural-gas sales and distribution systems in other parts of the U.S. Compared with earlier CenterPoint stranded-cost debt, the yields set by bankers in the recent deal were higher, relative to benchmarks.</p>\n\n<p>January Sale</p>\n\n<p>CenterPoint offered the securities Jan. 11 through banks led by Goldman Sachs at rates averaging 2.5 percent, which was the lowest ever for such a bond sale, according to the utility commission. Still, the costs to be borne by consumers could have been kept even lower than the 3.03 percent coupon on the bond maturing in October 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The top-rated issue\u2019s relative yield compared with a benchmark swap index was triple that of most similar longer-term issues from the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A bigger yield means higher electricity rates are needed to repay the debt.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cInvestors like this paper,\u201d Weili Chen, an S&amp;P analyst in New York, said by telephone. \u201cFor the same rating you earn a higher yield.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Moved Market</p>\n\n<p>A Citigroup Inc. (C) analysis showed the market moved after the deal, widening the spread, or difference, in yield for similar 10-year, AAA rated debt against swap indexes the bank uses by as much as two-thirds -- a sign that the Houston-based utility\u2019s sale carried a higher interest rate than the market demanded. The spread had barely moved during the previous year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
