He's very territorial about his space, but really is the sweetest dog.  I didn't get to the door right away because I was waiting for Lyndon to behave himself so the UPS guy left the package under a chair on our front porch.  When Lyndon calmed down, I opened the door and the UPS guy was just getting into his truck.  On top of the package was a pretty good sized milkbone (which we don't normally give to Lyndon so he was quite excited about it).  \n\nIt was the nicest thing ever and makes me want to order something from Amazon just so I can thank our UPS guy. I expect these things at places like Petco, but does anyone else's mail delivery people carry treats?  It's such a great idea!   ",
