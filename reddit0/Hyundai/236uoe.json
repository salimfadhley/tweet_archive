He's been a part of Ford, Toyota, among others and knows everything and anything about cars and how the industry works. I haven't talked to mods about this yet, just wanted to get a head count. (I don't even know if these kinds of posts are allowed tbh). Anyways, if this gets enough attention I'll set up a date with the mods and I'll let Mike know.\n\nedit: couple words\n\n\nedit #2: Alright, I'll let him know and then update with a future date if he agrees to do it! He's flying back from the New York Auto Show (I think) some time today.\n\n:)",
