  "selftext": "I've got a question about yesterdays results [announcement](http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/investors/2015/2015_lbg_hy_results.pdf) and [analysts conference](http://webcasts.lloydsbankinggroup.com/results/2015halfyear/webcast_flash.asp). \n\nLooking at the [share price movements](http://imgur.com/fSXeQMH) for that day. The share price was fairly stable with an upward trend since the start of the conference (~9:30AM) up until a large drop. This slump came in at about 10:40AM - 10:50AM which match exactly with the questions raised by an analyst from Mcquarie - Ed (1h 11m into the conference). The analyst raised two questions:\n\n\n1. Impairment cover as a percentage of impaired loans decreased from 57.1% ([p. 5](http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/investors/2015/2015_lbg_q1_ims.pdf)) to 55.1% ([p. 32](http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/investors/2015/2015_lbg_hy_results.pdf)). LLOY released \u00a3250MM as a result of this (\u00a312.5B of impaired loans * 2% cover reduction).\n\n2. [Plevin case](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/may/27/banks-face-bigger-ppi-mis-selling-bill-regulator-compensation-rules-fca-supreme-court) - which could potentially open LLOY to further claims.\n\n\n\nIf you watch the conference you'll clearly see that was the only time LLOY was actually put under the pressure. I thought their answers were weak and even at one point the analyst was cut-off from speaking further. I was looking at press releases with analysis of the results and came across a piece by [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2015/07/31/why-shares-in-lloyds-banking-group-plc-fell-after-one-of-its-best-quarters/). However, it focused on the lack of growth and increase of PPI provision and didn't even mention impairment cover reduction and the possible impact of Plevin case.\n\nMy question is whether I'm right in my assumption that the main contributing factors to this sharp price decline were in fact these two issues considering that the timing match perfectly? What are your thoughts? Also, does anyone recognise this Analyst from Macquarie? It'd be interesting to find out what exactly he was trying to say about the quality of their book?",
