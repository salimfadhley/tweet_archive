He was able to offer this because his dad had a deal fall through and has to line up a buyer. I&#39;ve sold a lot of expensive stuff, but nothing like this. The thing is I know there is a lot of money to be made with then. They are on back order till 2020, but these are new, open for any customizations, and available at the beginning of Q2 of this year. They are being sold waaaaay under the normal amount and I&#39;m not sure where to start. Any ideas?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
