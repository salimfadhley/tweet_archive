  "selftext": "It struck me today that some people may not be aware of the Scanning Code of Practice. The Scanning Code of Practice is a *voluntary* code developed by Canadian retailers and endorsed by the Competition Bureau of Canada. \n\nThe code basically boils down to this: In a participating store, if the price of a scanned item is higher than the shelf price or any other displayed price, then the consumer is entitled to the **first** of that item for free (if buying more than one), up to $10. If the item is over $10, then the customer is entitled to a $10 credit for that item.\n\nFor example, today I went to Canadian Tire and got myself a Dremel. I also picked up some extra cut-off wheels, which were priced at $10.49 on the shelf. When I got to the cash register, the wheels scanned in as $11.29. I told the cashier about the shelf price being lower, we confirmed that it wasn't for another product, and I got the wheels for $0.49.\n\nNow, like I said, this is a voluntary code. Although it's backed by the competition bureau, it's not law. However, a [surprising number of large retailers](http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/vwapj/280505ConsumerAdvisoryParticipants_e.pdf/$file/280505ConsumerAdvisoryParticipants_e.pdf) (PDF) participate in it. Here's a complete list for those who can't view the PDF link:\n\n\n- Shoppers Drug Mart\n- The Groupe Jean Coutu (NB and Ont only)\n- Lawton Drug Stores\n- London Drugs\n- Lovell Drugs\n- Pharmasave (BC and Sask) \n- Canada Safeway Limited\n- The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company of Canada Limited\n- Loblaw Companies Limited\n- Sobeys Inc.\n- Metro Inc.\n- Thrifty Foods\n- Costco Wholesale Canada Ltd.\n- Co-op Atlantic\n- Federated Co-operatives Limited\n- Coleman\u2019s Food Centre (Nfld.)\n- The Home Depot Canada\n- Canadian Tire Corporation Ltd.\n- Toys r Us\n- Wal-Mart Canada Corp.\n- Giant Tiger Stores Ltd.\n- The North West Company\n- Best Buy/Future Shop ( in implementation stage)\n- 2 Home Hardware franchisees \n- Thrifty Foods\n- Overwaitea Food Group\n- The Harry Watson Group\n- Longos Brothers Fruit Markets\n\n+ 1374 independent locations\n\n\nNow obviously the idea isn't to try and take advantage of this, but it's good to be informed. [Here's some more info](http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01262.html) on the code itself from the Competition Bureau.",
