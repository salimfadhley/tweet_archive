Not the awesome fatty with backwards compatibility, but the 80gb with nothing special. \nFast forward a few years. I&#39;ve run out of drive space. Because I&#39;m lazy, and we&#39;re going home anyway, I decide to trade my mother PlayStations. She&#39;s got a 120gb Slim. \nThe thing about this Slim is that it was my stepdad&#39;s. He&#39;s gone now. He passed a few years ago. Gaming was one of the things we shared. We played Ocarina of Time together. We played Jak and Daxter, GTA3... the list goes on. I wouldn&#39;t game as much as I do if he hadn&#39;t fostered the interest. \nThat console is one of the few reminders I have of him. \nSo needless to say, when we completed the swap and I discovered the blu-ray eye was out, I was extremely bummed. We tried a local repair company. No dice. \nSo then, despite warnings that I&#39;d just get a swapped console, I sent it off to Sony. \nIt took 3 weeks. It came back today. I opened it and immediately noticed that the casing wasn&#39;t new. Hoping against hope, I turned it on. \nThe data was there. It&#39;s my console. It&#39;s my stepdad&#39;s console. It took everything I had not to cry. Sony fixed it. They didn&#39;t swap it, they fixed it. I&#39;ve never been happier with a company than I am with Sony at this moment. \nI just wanted someplace to get that off my chest. It&#39;s fine if Reddit doesn&#39;t care, but I do, and I just wanted to share. \nTL,DR: Sony didn&#39;t swap out my dead stepdad&#39;s console, they took the time to replace the broken part and send me the same console back. I almost cried from happiness.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I.... Wow guys. Didn&#39;t expect Front Page of <a href=\"/r/gaming\">r/gaming</a>. Thanks. It makes my day. =)\nEDIT 2: Front Page???? Guys, you really rock. All of you. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
