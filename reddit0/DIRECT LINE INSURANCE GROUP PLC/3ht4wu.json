  "selftext": "Car Insurance help for new driver?\nI just passed my test yesterday. I have a Vauxhall Corsa active 16V 1.2 2004(3 Door). I asked my friends who have recently passed how much they got on their insurance. One of my friends got 1100 on a 9month deal (Direct Line) on their 2009 VW Golf. And another one of my friends also on direct line got 1300 on their Ford Fiesta (X reg). When I come to get my quote they range from 1900-3000!! I've added near enough the same details. Mother main driver, fully comp all that. So I want to know is what is it that's allows them to get cheaper car insurance? Or is there something I'm doing wrong? Perhaps suggest another insurance company (I've looked at most). But any advice would be most appreciated. Young driver wanting to have his freedom.\n\nTry :PROTECTIONQUOTES.NET",
