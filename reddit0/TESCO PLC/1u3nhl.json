  "selftext": "My investment philosophy is closely related to Buffett & Graham and I'm buying to hold for life.\n\nHalf of my portfolio consists of KO, PEP, MCD, WFC, WMT, TESCO PLC and today I bought little bit of MDT, mostly to remember to buy more if it drops.\n\nThe other half consists of similar companies that are long term investments, but are related to Northern Europe, which I think you may not be familiar of. Except for Hennes & Mauritz?\n\nSo, my concern is mostly related to the future scenarios of these companies, even though I'm fully aware of their competitive advantages and great products.\n\n-Future of Banking: Banks are approximately 13% of my portfolio, but can they truly be considered as stocks for retirement? World is changing rapidly and I'm positive that there will be some sort effect on banks.\n\n**What speaks for the need for the banks in the future and how will they keep their profits healthy?** Especially in nordic people are steadily paying their debts on their houses and kids inherit their parents houses. Will banks migrate completely into wealth management?\n\nReassuring is that businesses etc. will still need loans, though. For some reason I couldn't find any data on my banks business/home loans, only the total amount loaned.\n\n**edit**: It seems I forgot several ways how banks make money, such as collecting fees from businesses and regular customers.\n\n-Future of Colas & Mcdonalds: I think it's very well known how fast-food and sodas such as coca-cola affect to our health. In my opinion health is one of the mega-trends of our time so that would be contrary to my investments. (One of the reasons I bought some MDT, even though the price isn't what I'd like)\n\nOne thing that is reassuring is that maybe the companies can see the trends and change their business accordingly. Also, to my knowledge tobacco business is still very much alive, so I'd expect that to die before people start caring about health-effects of soda & fast-food.\n\n**How do you see the future of sodas and fast-food?**\n\nI'm hoping to spur some good conversation about these. On short-term my portfolio looks fantastic, but I'd like to think more broadly about the truly long-term, which is 20-30years+",
