  "selftext": "I wrote this for myself awhile ago.  Then later typed it up for a friend to run.  \nNow I present it to you, for your gradual acceptance or immediate dismissal.  \nI intentionally become increasingly vague in the mission outline to allow room for improvisation.  \nWithout further ado...\n***  \n##Intro  \nParanoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopian future similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four, Logan's Run and THX 1138 among others; however, the tone of the game is rife with black humor, frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy. As a citizen of the immense and futuristic city of Alpha Complex you assist The Computer in dealing with mutants and secret societies (especially Communists).  \nTo deal with these threats as Troubleshooters, you will go out, find trouble, and shoot it.\n\n> You\u2019ve just put in two long shifts in a row\u2014a hectic morning shift spent tracking down a cyborged Computer Phreaker whose new virus hopelessly snarled autocar traffic across the sector, creating massive traffic jams and resulting in several serious accidents, followed by an evening shift of overtime at your service firm helping to catch up lost productivity caused by the morning traffic problems. You ended up getting to your scheduled dinnertime too late for anything but the last dregs of mashed foamtatoes, and then missed the new episode of Teela-O. So you\u2019re understandably cranky when you finally drag yourself into your apartment and collapse into your bunk for some well-deserved rest, no Sandallathon (Sleepy-Sleepy pills) required.  \nOne hour and 17 minutes later, having completed the Minimum Sleep Interval specified by Health & Hygiene codes, a Mission Alert spitting noisily from your apartment's line printer ... \n\n***  \nCharacter Creation notes:  \n- Each player gets to customize up to 6 sub-skills at +4.  For each enhanced sub-skill, a sub-skill in the same set must be 1.  \n- Energy Weapons gets an automatic +4 with no penalty.  \n- Service Group through Personal Equipment is already written on pre-gen character sheet.  \n- Mandatory Bonus Duty is given in Briefing.  \n- Information in parentheses is for GMs eyes only.  Don't write it on the character sheet.  \n- I feel my characters are well balanced and entertainingly contradictory. However, you can print them out on separate sheets then start crossing out and swapping traits until you like what you have.  \n***  \n##Character #1\n**Service Group**: Power Services  \n**Management**: 19  \n**Stealth**: 6  \n**Violence**: 14  \n**Hardware**: 7  \n**Software**: 17  \n**Wetware**: 4  \n**Mutant Power**: Puppeteer (can control others, might get the wrong person, might get left and right mixed)  \n**Secret Society**: Commie  \n**Secret Skills**:  \n- Demolition (treasonous)  \n- Tractor Maintenance  \n- Propaganda  \n**Personal Equipment**:  \n- Indigo Pocket Calculator   \n- Fake Yellow Laser Barrel   \n- 1 Grenade,  \n- Teela-O-MLY pocket mirror  \n- Stungun  \n- Infrared Goggles  \n**Mandatory Bonus Duty**: Team Leader  \n**PLC equipment**: none (ha ha)  \n**R&D equipment**:  \n- Invisible Ladder (Lots of Agility rolls for walking through doors and turning corners and for everyone else every time he moves),  \n- Battery (Think car battery - heavy, cumbersome, and a bitch to carry)  \n**Current Society Mission**: Before arriving at the briefing the team sees a sign on the wall commanding all Commies to recruit one new member before next meeting.\n\n## Character #2  \n**Service Group**: Tech Services  \n**Management**: 7  \n**Stealth**: 19  \n**Violence**: 7  \n**Hardware**: 11  \n**Software**: 13  \n**Wetware**: 19  \n**Mutant Power**: Growth (might get big when small is wanted, might get too big when big is wanted, might only affect part of the body)  \n**Secret Society**: Anti-Mutant  \n**Secret Skills**:  \n- Mutant Power Studies   \n- Comic Book Trivia   \n- Twitch Talk  \n**Personal Equipment**:  \n- Green Yo-yo,   \n- Green Energy Pistol   \n- Brassknuckles   \n- Fake Red Barrel  \n- 20 moist towelettes   \n- Duct Tape  \n**Mandatory Bonus Duty**: Equipment Guy  \n**PLC equipment**: 1 Light Bulb (no padding)  \n**R&D equipment**: Old Time Reckoning Gun (A gun with a sphere connecting the handle and the barrel.

(Already has this on the character sheet)  \n***  \n##The Mission  \nHere's a list of conflict concepts.  \nFeel free to mix and match .  \n\n1: **Mission Briefing**:  \n- See quoted text at the post's start.  \n- Players receive an announcement to go to briefing while they're in their bunk.  (A print out with the location - and directions, if you're feeling generous)  \n- Players can do whatever before leaving.  \n\n2: Briefing:  \n- On the way, PC #1 & #3 are given their secret missions.  See character notes.  \n- The scene: a 10'x10', nothing but a podium opposite the door.  The floor is orange on the podiums half of the room, red on the door's (player's) side of the room.  Every second they stay, the red side of the room gets smaller and the orange side gets larger (maybe only when the players are watching - someone watching it is the only way to keep the floor from shrinking (a player must physically, actually stare at the floor out of character).   (If they don't figure it out, they have to receive their briefing while standing out in the hallway.  They should also be shamed & berated).  \n- A yellow Briefing officer (think Chevy Chase) flanked by two burly orange guards (two clones of WWF's Undertaker) enters after the players have been there for a few minutes.  Chevy says, \"Your mission is to change the light bulb in room #q23p92t.  Are you paying attention?  Look at me!  Not the floor!  I'll leave your MBDs on the podium.  \\*pause\\* [Name of PC #2], did you get my text message?  Oh, stop by PLC & R&D for outfitting beforehand\"  Chevy leaves the Undertakers behind to prevent player's from breaking any rules (such as transversing the orange floors between the players and the podium, where their MBD, the M is for mandatory, are located.\n\n3: Outfitting:\n3A: Go PLC (It's up to you to decide how easy it is to get there?  Do the players know?  Did Chevy or an Undertaker tell them?)  \n- There is a really long line (3-6 hr wait time). PC #5 gets secret mission.  \n- PCs may jump ahead? Of big mean guys? Do guards see them?  \n- Illegal vendor just around corner? Who has Crappy goods? or Good but expensive goods? Only deals in trades? Runs away just before cops come and catch PCs? Or he is cops?  \n-  Another PLC with no line, around another corner. PCs should not trust you, but its true!)  \n- Who distributes the equipment? The clerk? Team Leader? Equipment guy?  \n\n3B:Go R&D. (Through a door right next to PLC?)  \n - On the way: PC #4 secret mission.  \n- A scientists asks the PCs to test equipment on a test subject and then stress test for the duration of the mission, then return items at debriefing. Scientist leaves.  \n- Another item hand out argument?  \n- Test subject is a Bull (and bulls hate red, like the troubleshooters uniforms).  Also, the troubleshoots have never seen a bull before. How do you describe it? (A big,huge, hairy mutant on all fours with stone for hands and feet, a tail, a brass nose ring, and horns! Big, long, pointy horns!)  \n- Ladder should be a problem, so should battery and rope, etc.  \n\n4: The Misson  \n4A: Go to room #q23p92t. (Do they know where q23p92t is?  Do they even remember what room they're going to?)  \n- Make them travel by train.  If they don't get on the train, it leaves and they have to walk on the tracks (Do I really need to tell you what happens next?).  If they hold the train too long, another train comes and crashes in to it (explosion).  \n- While on train, it makes a regularly scheduled stop in the middle of a tunnel to ensure train schedules remain accurate.  It powers done, it is pitch black. (Pass someone a note: \"How are you?\" or \"What's your favorite color?\"). Get players to scheme.  Later, power up the train at an inconvenient time and head to the destination arrive, same problems - get off or get hit.  \n- Right before reaching room #q23p92t there's a check point, or metal detector? (Empty your pockets or deal with locked blast doors).    \n- At some point PCs must cross a wrong colored hallway.  (There are no cameras.  Who gonna know?  So long as we all keep out mouths shut...)\n\n4B: Room #q23p92t   \n- Are there many lights are out? Or maybe the lights aren't out?  Maybe another room's light is out?  \n- No matter the situation, the light the players want to interact with is out of reach and the light fixture covering is locked? There should be witnesses. Lots and lots of witnesses.  (Especially to see players using an invisible ladder, or as anyone else sees it: floating like a mutant)\n\n4C: Go back to briefing.  \n- Use some tricks you haven't used yet.  \n- Keep it simple, there should be plenty of in-fighting.  You know you're doing good when you don't have add anything.\n\n5: Debriefing.  \n- All equipment should be turned in.  Even personal items, especially if they lost or broke it (just to be mean).  \n- They should have changed the wrong light or did something technically wrong and failed.  \n- Get them to explain every little mistake and blame each other for everything.  \n\nEND.",

See character notes.<br/>\n- The scene: a 10&#39;x10&#39;, nothing but a podium opposite the door.  The floor is orange on the podiums half of the room, red on the door&#39;s (player&#39;s) side of the room.  Every second they stay, the red side of the room gets smaller and the orange side gets larger (maybe only when the players are watching - someone watching it is the only way to keep the floor from shrinking (a player must physically, actually stare at the floor out of character).

Chevy says, &quot;Your mission is to change the light bulb in room #q23p92t.  Are you paying attention?  Look at me!  Not the floor!

Or he is cops?<br/>\n-  Another PLC with no line, around another corner. PCs should not trust you, but its true!)<br/>\n- Who distributes the equipment? The clerk? Team Leader? Equipment guy?  </p>\n\n<p>3B:Go R&amp;D. (Through a door right next to PLC?)<br/>\n - On the way: PC #4 secret mission.<br/>\n- A scientists asks the PCs to test equipment on a test subject and then stress test for the duration of the mission, then return items at debriefing. Scientist leaves.<br/>\n- Another item hand out argument?<br/>\n- Test subject is a Bull (and bulls hate red, like the troubleshooters uniforms).  Also, the troubleshoots have never seen a bull before. How do you describe it? (A big,huge, hairy mutant on all fours with stone for hands and feet, a tail, a brass nose ring, and horns! Big, long, pointy horns!)<br/>\n- Ladder should be a problem, so should battery and rope, etc.  </p>\n\n<p>4: The Misson<br/>\n4A: Go to room #q23p92t. (Do they know where q23p92t is?  Do they even remember what room they&#39;re going to?)<br/>\n- Make them travel by train.  If they don&#39;t get on the train, it leaves and they have to walk on the tracks (Do I really need to tell you what happens next?).  If they hold the train too long, another train comes and crashes in to it (explosion).<br/>\n- While on train, it makes a regularly scheduled stop in the middle of a tunnel to ensure train schedules remain accurate.  It powers done, it is pitch black. (Pass someone a note: &quot;How are you?&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s your favorite color?&quot;). Get players to scheme.  Later, power up the train at an inconvenient time and head to the destination arrive, same problems - get off or get hit.<br/>\n- Right before reaching room #q23p92t there&#39;s a check point, or metal detector? (Empty your pockets or deal with locked blast doors).<br/>\n- At some point PCs must cross a wrong colored hallway.  (There are no cameras.  Who gonna know?  So long as we all keep out mouths shut...)</p>\n\n<p>4B: Room #q23p92t<br/>\n- Are there many lights are out? Or maybe the lights aren&#39;t out?  Maybe another room&#39;s light is out?<br/>\n- No matter the situation, the light the players want to interact with is out of reach and the light fixture covering is locked? There should be witnesses. Lots and lots of witnesses.  (Especially to see players using an invisible ladder, or as anyone else sees it: floating like a mutant)</p>\n\n<p>4C: Go back to briefing.<br/>\n- Use some tricks you haven&#39;t used yet.<br/>\n- Keep it simple, there should be plenty of in-fighting.  You know you&#39;re doing good when you don&#39;t have add anything.</p>\n\n<p>5: Debriefing.<br/>\n- All equipment should be turned in.  Even personal items, especially if they lost or broke it (just to be mean).<br/>\n- They should have changed the wrong light or did something technically wrong and failed.<br/>\n- Get them to explain every little mistake and blame each other for everything.  </p>\n\n<p>END.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
