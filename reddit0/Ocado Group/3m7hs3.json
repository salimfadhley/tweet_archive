Here. No need to leave Reddit!\n\nFeedback appreciated.\n\n****\n\n# #TeamLCIF: Getting London VCs Moving\n\n## A who\u2019s who in the London Co-Investment Fund ecosystem\n\nEuropean startups often whine about the lack of seed capital they can tap into. Sure, there are hundreds of venture capitalists in London, but let\u2019s face it, London\u2019s not \u201cthe Valley\u201d.\n\nThe typical experience for entrepreneurs is a meeting with an ex-banker or consultant who\u2019s never worked in a startup. The VC asks for metrics and proof of traction and the entrepreneur is deflated that the VC doesn\u2019t buy into their vision. The inevitable conclusion is that the startup is too early stage for them. The entrepreneur goes home, disappointed and slates the VC to his startup buddies.\n\n\u201cGrow up\u201d, I say. Don\u2019t blame the VCs. They are custodians of other people\u2019s money. It isn\u2019t \u201cthe Valley\u201d where hundreds of people have created billions of dollars of wealth, and are now pouring it back into the next generation of entrepreneurs. You can reel off Europe\u2019s big success stories in an instant. They include: ARM, Autonomy, Betfair, Iliad, Just-Eat, MySQL, Ocado, SAP, Skype, and TomTom, and Waze. Not much else.\n\n## Filling the Vacuum\n\nThe crunch point for startups seems to be at the seed level. But there are a few avenues for entrepreneurs to pursue. Foremost is the collective of accelerators in London, who\u2019ll give a startup the ability to run on fumes. Notable firms include: Seedcamp, Startupbootcamp, Techstars and Wayra.\n\nAs good as Seedcamp and the accelerators are, they are not silver bullets. First time entrepreneurs need their own source of funding. Typically from friends and family. If you don\u2019t have the self-belief to tap your own network, then you\u2019ll probably find that others won\u2019t have the belief in you either. Perception is almost as important as reality.\n\n## The Unsung Hero\n\nIn this \u201ctough\u201d environment, there is an unsung hero for early stage start-ups. It\u2019s the London Co-Investment Fund. And shockingly, it\u2019s got little mainstream press. Imagine a \u00a325m fund explicitly designed to help early stage businesses in London, backed by the London Mayor\u2019s Office, working with 10 of London\u2019s best early stage investors. It\u2019s not too good to be true. But it is complicated, though not in a bad way.\n\nIt all started six years ago, when John Spindler persuaded the European Union & the London Mayor\u2019s office to back Capital Enterprise, an organisation bringing all the universities, accelerators and VCs of London together. Next, he launched the Capital Accelerator Program in 2013, which has paid for staff at London VC firms and helped over 130 startups raise money. CAP has injected both dynamism into London\u2019s VC community and paid for additional resources to vet and support early stage start-ups.\n\nBut increasing the resources and expertise at London\u2019s VCs was never going to be enough. Thus the creation of the London Co-Investment Fund in partnership with Funding London. In December 2014, after 18 months of negotiation, Boris Johnson took to the stage at City Hall to announce the investment of the city\u2019s money in the fund. Now, London based startups can get a significant boost to their funding by getting the London Co-Investment Fund to invest in them alongside one of the founding VC partners.\n\nRoll forward to September 2015, just 10 months later, and 25 businesses have received funding. That\u2019s more than any single early stage VC firm in London. Note, these startups have successfully raised a total of \u00a318 million, with the London Co-Investment Fund contributing \u00a33.5 million.\n\n## What\u2019s the Catch?\n\nYes, there are multiple catches and complications, but none should deter you from wanting to play a part in the London Co-Investment Fund\u2019s eco-system.\n\nFirstly, the fund doesn\u2019t exist as a stand alone entity. It was co-founded by John Spindler\u2019s Capital Enterprise and Maggie Rodriguez-Piza\u2019s Funding London. Capital Enterprise review all the applications and Funding London manages the actual fund. On a day-to-day basis, Puneet Raj Bhatia is the man in charge.\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s a co-investment fund. If one of the 10 VC partners isn\u2019t interested in your start-up, then the London Co-Investment Fund can\u2019t play. Why? The fund are custodians of government money. So they have to leave the business negotiation to the VCs. It\u2019s what protects us all from falling foul of the EU\u2019s state-subsidy rules.\n\nThirdly, it\u2019s government money. So the Greater London Authority needs to know what\u2019s happening, i.e. they have information rights. And top of their agenda is seeing job creation in London.\n\nFourth, the London Co-Investment Fund takes 25% of any fundraising. The whole aim of the fund is to encourage private investment in London based start-ups. Private money must take the lead, rightly so. Remember, the first 25 start-ups have raised a total of \u00a318m, with \u00a314.5m coming from the VC partners and \u00a33.5m from the fund.\n\nFinally, bring your own money to the table. If you don\u2019t have friends and family or a group of angels willing to be the first 25%+ of your fund raise, then you are probably dreaming. Yes, as a first time entrepreneur, you are dreaming and wasting your time.\n\n## Getting into the eco-system\n\nSo there are two gatekeepers: Capital Enterprise and the VCs. To get to Capital Enterprise, you need to fill in the online application form. Then John and his colleagues, Rosa Glover and Sia Georgieva will get back to you with feedback. If you\u2019re the right fit, you get invited to join their \u201cGreen Light Programme\u201d. That\u2019s a weekly mentoring evening over 8 weeks, where you meet with the different VCs and the other illuminati of the London VC community. For example, Mike Butcher of TechCrunch gave a brilliant talk on how to interact with journalists.\n\nGetting to the VCs can be via the Greenlight Programme or you can go direct. To some extent, meeting the VCs on your own, may be a plus. That way you stand out. You\u2019re a a startup they know independent of the London Co-Investment Fund.\n\n## The Trailblazers\n\nSo who are the VCs and what investments have they done with the London Co-Investment Fund already?\n\nBack in December 2014, 5 VCs joined the eco-system: AngelLabs; Crowdcube; Firestartr; London Business Angels; and Playfair Capital. Yes, yes, Crowdcube isn\u2019t a VC, I know. Though a couple of the other partners aren\u2019t traditional VCs either. They\u2019re more like angel networks.\n\n### AngelLabs\n\nAngelLabs is a vehicle for over 30 angel investors, pooling their resources together to source deals. Andrew Fullerton, Kevin Chong and Maria Dramalioti-Taylor run the show. They vet the deals and present them to their angels. It\u2019s an a la carte arrangement. With 29 companies in the portfolio today, the Lab is working well! Since joining the eco-system, AngelLab has co-invested in 4 startups with the London Co-Investment Fund, including Chaser & We Now Comply. Both are B2B businesses, though AngelLabs doesn\u2019t have a narrow remit.\n\n### Crowdcube\n\nCrowdcube\u2019s the UK\u2019s leader in crowdfunding having over 200,000 investors on it\u2019s books, and having raised over \u00a3100m for 300 companies. Stuart Nicol leads the team that vet\u2019s the London Co-Investment Fund deals.\n\nTo date five deals have successfully raised funds via Crowdcube, including Chirp, Droplet, Gamesgrabr, Powervault & Shoot Gardening. Clearly the range of investments is broad, but there is one common theme, are they businesses that the \u201ccrowd\u201d can connect with emotionally. So complex technology and B2B businesses are less obvious for this partner.\n\n### Firestartr\n\nFirestartr has 20 startups in its portfolio today. Axel Wehr is the Principal from Firestartr that you\u2019re most likely to meet at any of the fund\u2019s events. Like the other partners, Firestartr doesn\u2019t have a formal fund structure but has a network of angels and investors that back their deals. To date, Firestartr\u2019s co-invested in 5 startups with the London Co-Investment Fund, including Tritto, Urban Massage & We Are Colony. Here you can see a \u201cplatform\u201d theme.\n\n\n### London Business Angels\n\nLondon Business Angels has been going for over 30 years and has one of the largest networks of angel investors in the UK. With the London Co-Investment Fund, they\u2019ve backed 9 companies including Captive Media, Desktop Genetics, FlatClub, LaSalle Education, & Step Jockey. This puts them out in front, as the leading partner for the fund. A position they can probably maintain if they remain interested in a broad range of start-ups.\n\n### Playfair Capital\n\nPlayfair Capital are the cool kids of the eco-system. Based at Warner Yard they rub shoulders with TechStars and it\u2019s UK cohort. The whole setup has the same energy as Passion Capital\u2019s White Bear Yard. Both eco-systems in their own right.\n\nTaking the glass elevator to the \u201cinvestors floor\u201d, overlooking the startups below, is a slightly unnerving experience. Though the smile of Playfair\u2019s Joe Charlesworth and relaxed style of Fede Pirzio-Biroli immediately put any jitters to rest. As the firm\u2019s name implies, they are on your side, easy to work with and startup friendly. With the London Co-Investment Fund they\u2019ve co-invested in Dojo & Pronto Technology. Both are B2C firms, though Playfair has plenty of B2B and B2B2C startups in it\u2019s 30+ portfolio.\n\n## Swelling the Ranks\n\nThis September, the eco-system doubled in size. Five new VCs joined the fund\u2019s ecosystem: Craigie Capital; Downing Ventures; EC1 Capital; Forward Partners, and; Seedcamp. Imagine, one application form getting you on the fast track with 10 of London\u2019s best early stage VCs?\n\n### Craigie Capital\n\nAlasdair McPherson is the point man for Craigie Capital. An angel investor in his own right, Alasdair\u2019s got a love for fintech. He\u2019s regularly seen mentoring at Barclays Techstar and Startupbootcamp. Though the team at Craigie Capital isn\u2019t focused on fintech. They are fans of B2B models including SaaS, Big Data, Security and plays on regulatory change.\n\n### Downing Ventures\n\nDowning Ventures is a part of Downing LLP who manage a number of Venture Capital Trusts, Enterprise Investment Schemes, OEICs, and other financial vehicles. Matt Penneycard is the point man. With 20 startups in their portfolio today, there isn\u2019t a narrow focus with both B2C and B2B plays welcome.\n\n### EC1 Capital\n\nLike many of the other partners, EC1 works with a network of angels to fund their deals. Yannick Roux is the point man. In 3 years they\u2019ve funded over 20 companies at the seed level. The portfolio has a broad make up.\n\n### Forward Partners\n\nForward Partners\u2019 founder, Nic Brisbourne has been a VC in London since before the dotcom boom & bust. He\u2019s got one of the more thoughtful blogs in the UK\u2019s venture community. But unlike the other partners, Forward is not a generalist. They focus on ecommerce companies and have a dedicated team that help the 30 companies they\u2019ve backed scale.\n\n### Seedcamp\n\nYou\u2019d have to be disconnected from the Internet to not have heard of Seedcamp. Carlos and Reshma have been running his accelerator since 2007. They are well connected to Index Ventures and other large venture firms. Seedcamp\u2019s backed over 200 start-ups with cash and they\u2019ve mentored thousands more.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not applied to Seedcamp Week, even to get exposure to their army of mentors, you are doing your startup a disservice.\n\nBut the obvious question is, why does Seedcamp want to join the London Co-Investment Fund\u2019s eco-system? Simple, they\u2019ve now got a \u20ac20 million fund. Their model has evolved. Seedcamp is no longer just an accelerator getting startups off the ground. They don\u2019t have to hand over the baton to their VC partners anymore. The teams they back in their accelerator can grow with Seedcamp through the Seed round, and possible beyond. Working with the London Co-Investment Fund is a good way for Seedcamp to put some of its new \u20ac20m fund to work. Tom Wilson\u2019s the point man.\n\n## Who\u2019s Missing?\n\nThere are a number of obvious VCs that are not in the eco-system: Accel; Amadeus; Balderton; DN; Index Ventures, Notion; Octopus; Passion; ProFounders, and; WhiteStar; come to mind. Then there are the crowdfunding platforms Seedrs and Syndicate Room.\n\nWhy? As far as I can tell it\u2019s a combination of three factors.\n\nFirstly, many of these VCs have access to the deal flow themselves. No founder ignores them and should try to pitch them directly. They are well staffed and can deal with the volume. As such, they just don\u2019t need the London Co-Investment Fund to act as a gatekeeper and co-funder.\n\nSecondly, they are structured as funds, with committed capital, often running to the hundreds of millions of dollars. They lead investments themselves. There isn\u2019t any need to have someone else\u2019s money in the deal, especially government money, benign as that money may be.\n\nAnd finally, seed rounds are the exception, not the rule for these firms. Face it, if you\u2019ve $100m to invest a year, do you want to write twenty cheques of $5m or two hundred cheques of $500k. Which model is more scalable?\n\n## Making a Difference\n\nThe London Co-Investment Fund has been operational for ten months. Over 700 start-ups have applied to the programme. Half of those start-ups contacted the fund directly. Half came via the VC partners. The fund is already making a valuable impact with the fund already backing 25 startups. It\u2019s no wonder the eco-system has just doubled in size.\n\nWhile the UK press are out chasing unicorns, London\u2019s startup community is starting to notice an important change. Local government isn\u2019t just talking about London\u2019s tech cluster. It\u2019s putting money to work. The goal for the Mayor\u2019s office is to back 150 startups over 3 years, via the London Co-Investment Fund, creating up to 2,600 new jobs. That\u2019s one investment a week.\n\nSo what are you waiting for. Click here and get your startup into the London Co-Investment Fund\u2019s ecosystem. We did and we couldn\u2019t be happier.",

With 20 startups in their portfolio today, there isn\u2019t a narrow focus with both B2C and B2B plays welcome.</p>\n\n<h3>EC1 Capital</h3>\n\n<p>Like many of the other partners, EC1 works with a network of angels to fund their deals. Yannick Roux is the point man. In 3 years they\u2019ve funded over 20 companies at the seed level. The portfolio has a broad make up.</p>\n\n<h3>Forward Partners</h3>\n\n<p>Forward Partners\u2019 founder, Nic Brisbourne has been a VC in London since before the dotcom boom &amp; bust. He\u2019s got one of the more thoughtful blogs in the UK\u2019s venture community. But unlike the other partners, Forward is not a generalist. They focus on ecommerce companies and have a dedicated team that help the 30 companies they\u2019ve backed scale.</p>\n\n<h3>Seedcamp</h3>\n\n<p>You\u2019d have to be disconnected from the Internet to not have heard of Seedcamp. Carlos and Reshma have been running his accelerator since 2007. They are well connected to Index Ventures and other large venture firms. Seedcamp\u2019s backed over 200 start-ups with cash and they\u2019ve mentored thousands more.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve not applied to Seedcamp Week, even to get exposure to their army of mentors, you are doing your startup a disservice.</p>\n\n<p>But the obvious question is, why does Seedcamp want to join the London Co-Investment Fund\u2019s eco-system? Simple, they\u2019ve now got a \u20ac20 million fund. Their model has evolved. Seedcamp is no longer just an accelerator getting startups off the ground. They don\u2019t have to hand over the baton to their VC partners anymore. The teams they back in their accelerator can grow with Seedcamp through the Seed round, and possible beyond. Working with the London Co-Investment Fund is a good way for Seedcamp to put some of its new \u20ac20m fund to work. Tom Wilson\u2019s the point man.</p>\n\n<h2>Who\u2019s Missing?</h2>\n\n<p>There are a number of obvious VCs that are not in the eco-system: Accel; Amadeus; Balderton; DN; Index Ventures, Notion; Octopus; Passion; ProFounders, and; WhiteStar; come to mind. Then there are the crowdfunding platforms Seedrs and Syndicate Room.</p>\n\n<p>Why? As far as I can tell it\u2019s a combination of three factors.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, many of these VCs have access to the deal flow themselves. No founder ignores them and should try to pitch them directly. They are well staffed and can deal with the volume. As such, they just don\u2019t need the London Co-Investment Fund to act as a gatekeeper and co-funder.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, they are structured as funds, with committed capital, often running to the hundreds of millions of dollars. They lead investments themselves. There isn\u2019t any need to have someone else\u2019s money in the deal, especially government money, benign as that money may be.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, seed rounds are the exception, not the rule for these firms. Face it, if you\u2019ve $100m to invest a year, do you want to write twenty cheques of $5m or two hundred cheques of $500k. Which model is more scalable?</p>\n\n<h2>Making a Difference</h2>\n\n<p>The London Co-Investment Fund has been operational for ten months. Over 700 start-ups have applied to the programme. Half of those start-ups contacted the fund directly. Half came via the VC partners. The fund is already making a valuable impact with the fund already backing 25 startups. It\u2019s no wonder the eco-system has just doubled in size.</p>\n\n<p>While the UK press are out chasing unicorns, London\u2019s startup community is starting to notice an important change. Local government isn\u2019t just talking about London\u2019s tech cluster. It\u2019s putting money to work. The goal for the Mayor\u2019s office is to back 150 startups over 3 years, via the London Co-Investment Fund, creating up to 2,600 new jobs. That\u2019s one investment a week.</p>\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for. Click here and get your startup into the London Co-Investment Fund\u2019s ecosystem. We did and we couldn\u2019t be happier.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
