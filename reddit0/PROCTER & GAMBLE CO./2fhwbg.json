I have experience only as a consulting engineer and I **hate** being a consultant.  Given the choice I would probably be highly excited in R&D or maybe controls.  However, I have zero worthwhile experience in either, the closest is my senior design project at college which was controls based and it did end with a successfully tested prototype so it maybe counts for something?\n\nI am trying to apply to the larger companies (I applied for an entry level position at Procter and Gamble recently) as I suspect that would work better for me than a small company.  Any help is much appreciated.  If you have any good leads I would be about as happy as a puppy if you helped me land a job elsewhere as my current job has been making me depressed and it (the job) is getting worse...",
