The problem I'm encountering now is that I can't have both my Garmin mount and a light attached to the bars at the same time, which is annoying.\n\nSo I'm looking at the 3T Integra LTD, which has an integrated Garmin mount. (How is that stem?) Problem is, if I get that, then I'll probably want to upgrade everything so they match.\n\nThe question, then, is is that upgrade worth it? The weight advantage is negligible to me (55g), so I'm curious about stiffness, comfort, and reliability.\n\nThanks.",
