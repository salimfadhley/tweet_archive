  "selftext": "Hello everyone, thank you in advance for taking the time to read my questions.  I'll apologize in advance for the large wall of text, I just want to give the most detailed information possible so that my questions will fully make sense. \n\nAbout 6 months ago my fiancee and I were pre-approved for a loan through a mortgage broker, we wanted to \"test the waters\" and see what sort of loans we were qualified for and how much money we could \"play with\" when looking for a house.  During the pre-approval process our Mortgage broker told us very clearly to not use our credit whatsoever because he did not want us to increase our debt to income ratio.  However, we've never had any debt and we both have very good credit scores.\n\nFast forward to the present.  My fiancee and I have spent the last 6 months getting ourselves ready to finally purchase our first home.  We have our down payment set aside, as well as a modest emergency fund and other savings.  We went back to the same mortgage broker and asked to be pre-approved again so that we could make serious offers, which we ended up making just last week.  \nNow however we've been told that we are no longer eligible for a loan!  Apparently our broker had been using information from our past pre-approval towards our current loan approval, and now that we were ready for financing he updated our information and found we were no longer eligible for a loan because of \"lack of current credit payment history\"...  Not only did he mess up on our information, but he specifically told us to stop using our credit, which is exactly the reason we're not eligible for a loan anymore...\n\nSo, here is what he's given us for possible solutions...\n1. We start \"rebuilding\" our credit payment history.  However, we've never had credit cards.  He says that if we got one and started now we would have to wait 6+ months for our history to be strong enough again.\n2. We become co-signers on someone else's credit account and \"piggy back\" off of their credit history.  He says this could give us enough \"history\" to be eligible withing 2-3 weeks...  However, when we co-signed onto my parent's account we were told by american express that their credit history would not influence ours because they issue separate card numbers.\n\nSo, what really are our options? How can we increase our credit payment history quickly so we can become eligible for our loan?  Are we doing to need to wait another 6 months to do it ourselves?  If this is the case we're going to be seriously disappointed.\n\nPlease, if you have any advice or insights please help.  Thank you all!\n\nNote:  My boss has also offered to add me onto the business account as a card holder so that I can \"piggy back\" off that credit history and perhaps become eligible that way.  However, I read that Chase does not add positive business credit history onto Personal Credit History.  Is this true?",
