When I purchased the gift card, I also went through fat wallet 1% cash back on the purchase (saved $1). The site I used to buy the card also had a $5 off $75 purchase coupon (saved $5). The gift card was delivered electronically instantly. After purchasing the card, I signed up my email to get $5 off a purchase at home depot (saved $5). I then went through fat wallet to make my purchase so I got 5% cash back on the purchase (saved about $5 since the cashback is on the total purchase).\n\n\nSo all in all, I saved approx. $32.50. $150-$32.50 = $117.50, or  22%. Also had this shipped to my home for free.\n\n\nFor cashback sites, I always check evreward and fat wallet.
