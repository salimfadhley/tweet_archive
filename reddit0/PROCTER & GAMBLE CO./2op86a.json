Thanks!\n\nExplain, in detail, the relationship between interest rates (i.e. yield to maturity) and bond prices. Is now a good time to invest in bonds?\n\nYou have been hired as a financial advisor to John Lester. He has received two offers for playing professional baseball and wants to select the best offer. Offer A is a $10m offer for $2m a year for 5 years. Offer B is a $11m offer of $1m a year for four years and $7m in year 5. Assuming a 9.75% discount rate what offer should he choose?\n\nAssume you purchased an 8% semi-annual Stations Casino, Inc. bond one year ago for $828.41 when the market rate of interest was 10% and the bond had 20 years to maturity. If the current market rate of interest is 13%, what would be the percentage change in bond value from the time you purchased this bond until today?\n\nCurrently the average house in your town cost $375,000 and is increasing in value by 3.7% per year. In seven years you plan to purchase an average house and will need to have a 20% down payment.\n\nIf you currently have $1,275 in your investment account, which earns 8% a year, how much must you save per month to have your down payment when you buy the house?\n\nThe terms of the loan are \u201c30 years, monthly payments, and 9% annual interest rate.\u201d How much are your monthly payments?\n\nSouthern Tours is considering acquiring Holiday Vacations.

Southern Tours has determined that a 13.5 percent rate of return is applicable to this potential acquisition. What is Southern Tours willing to pay today to acquire Holiday Vacations?\n\nYou just received an insurance settlement offer related to an accident you had six years ago. The offer gives you a choice of one of the following three offers: \n\nOption A\n\n$1,565 a month for 72 months\n\nOption B\n\n$1,012 a month for 10 years\n\nOption C\n\n$100,000 as a lump sum payment today\n\n\nYou can earn 7.5% on your investments. You do not care if you personally receive the funds or if they are paid to your heirs should you die within the settlement period. Which option should you choose, why?\n\nYou just purchased a bond that matures in 5 years. The bond has a face value of $1,000 and has an 8% annual coupon. The bond has a current yield (CY) of 8.21%. What is the bond\u2019s yield to maturity? What is the capital gain yield?\n\nBauer Inc., just paid a dividend of $1.95 per share and has a beta of 1.14. The expected return on the market is 6.5% and the risk free rate is 2.25%.\n\nAssuming a constant dividend growth rate of 3%, what is the value per share of Bauer, Inc.?\n\nBauer, Inc. just announced the development of a new manufacturing process that will significantly decrease cost and increase production. Management anticipates that this new process will double or even triple its profit margin. Therefore, Bauer decided to increase its dividend by 20% each year for the next 6 years. After that time it will decrease its dividend to a constant 3% rate. What is the value per share of Bauer?\n\nAfter further analysis, you realize that instead of immediately dropping to 3% Bauer will slowly decrease its dividend to 3% over 15 years. What is the value per share?\n\nThe common stock of Jensen Shipping has an expected return of 16.3 percent. The return on the market is 10.8 percent and the risk-free rate of return is 3.8 percent.

However, you do not want to start withdrawing your retirement accounts and social security until 62.You must, therefore, fund 7 years\u2019 worth of living expenses and you estimate you\u2019ll need $5,750/month during that period. You earn 3% on any money invested in non-retirement accounts during the 55-62 time period and can earn 6% annually on your investments prior to age 55.\n\nHow much must you invest at the end of each month starting next month to fund your early retirement?\n\nYou get paid every two weeks; how much must you deposit each paycheck to fund your early retirement?\n\nYou are examining two bonds. Bond A is a 9.875 % coupon semi-annual bond that matures in 20 years. Bond B is a 20 year zero-coupon bond. The yield to maturity for each bond is 7.50% and the par value for each is $1,000.\n\nFor each bond indicate if it is a premium bond, discount bond, or par bond.\n\nWhat is the current price of each bond?\n\nPlot the price path for each bond from now until maturity.\n\nConsider the following stocks:\n\nStock\n\nBeta\n\nLast Dividend\n\nGrowth Rate\n\nCurrent Price\n\nBlackstone Group (BX)\n\n2.03\n\n$1.18\n\n3.60%\n\n$32.95\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS)\n\n0.92\n\n$2.48\n\n5.25%\n\n$107.35\n\nProcter and Gamble Co.
