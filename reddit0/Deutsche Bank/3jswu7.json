Seeing the pro's up close was awesome and I would do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nAs I walked onto the golf course I went to the 9th fairway. As I arrived Kevin Chappell was getting ready to hit his approach shot, but it appeared he was messing with some gear in his bag. To my left were 3 young girls with their parents cheering for all the golfers. After hitting his shot, Kevin turned and tossed 3 autographed golf balls to the girls cheering. They didn't really understand what was happening bu their parents were thrilled. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/fLXVT7g\n\nI didn't know this at the time but Kevin Chappell is ranked 68 in FedEx cup points. He is T3 right now at -8. For him to do something like this in the playoffs in an important round was awesome. \n\n\n",
