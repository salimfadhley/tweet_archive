I am a Fellow and Vice President of Technical Strategy for IBM Research at the Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Prior to this, I led the research team that created the first 1-gigahertz RISC processor chip, and was responsible for the group that developed the ISA Systems Bus, an integral component for making [the first Personal Computers](http://www.ibm.com/ibm100/us/en/icons/personalcomputer/) possible.\n\nIt seems like there are many kindred spirits here on Reddit, so I thought it\u2019d be fun to come on today and answer any questions you might have about computer science, engineering, programming, your first PC -- you name it.\n\nAs tempting as it is, I still have a day job and can\u2019t stay on all day, but I\u2019ll be checking in for the next half-hour, again at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, and then later this afternoon at 4:30 to answer as many questions as I can.\n\nSo go ahead, ask me anything!\n\n**Edit:** Hey everyone, I had no idea I'd get so many questions! This is great, and I'm going to try to answer as many as possible. I can only check in periodically throughout the day, though, so thanks for being patient with me. Keep 'em coming! ",
