  "selftext": "Associations Test Drive New Member Ratings Program\nBy Carolyn Schwaar\n\nOctober 25, 2013\n\nFrom Angie\u2019s List and Yelp to TripAdvisor and Amazon, Web sites that rate and review are what consumers crave. Americans today rarely buy something, dine somewhere, or hire someone who hasn\u2019t been thoroughly assessed, graded, and starred.\n\nReal estate agents are not immune, although reliable rankings have been difficult to find. Complaints over review sites that are open to the public point out that the reviews could be written by anyone. Then there are the sites that sell high ratings or charge agents to remove fabricated customer complaints, including one that NAR\u2019s legal department recently worked to shut down, REALTOR-complaints.com. Another site, agentratings.com, has been attracting complaints from agents who say the reviews are fake.\n\nWhere are members to turn?\nThe NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS\u00ae, through its subsidiary, the Center for Specialized REALTOR\u00ae Education, has stepped in to test a rating program based only on client reviews. Called the REALTOR\u00ae Excellence Program, it aims to deliver not only public ratings (if the agent wants them public) but also customer service evaluations on a range of areas to be used internally by brokerages to boost agent performance and reduce legal liability.\n\nThe program has been underway at about 24 REALTOR\u00ae associations since spring. It is subsidized by NAR and local associations (but free to members) and operated by Quality Service Certification Inc., a California-based real estate technology company with more than a dozen years of experience evaluating agents using a customer service survey method and offering its Quality Service \u00adCertified professional designation.\n\nPrudential Starck, REALTORS\u00ae, member brokerage of the Mainstreet Organization of REALTORS\u00ae in Illinois, is making participation in the REALTOR\u00ae Excellence Program mandatory for its 450 agents in 12 offices. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to get surveyed to keep it pure,\u201d CEO Andrew Starck told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cIt can\u2019t be doctored or tempered. We\u2019re not afraid of a bad review. The way we positioned it was, we want to know how we\u2019re doing so we can get better.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t run from ratings\nAccording to QSC CEO Larry Romito, three major forces are driving interest in a program like the REALTOR\u00ae Excellence Program: consumer demand for ratings, the growing number of real estate agent rating sites already out there, and broker demand for heightened professionalism.\n\n\u201cThere are real positives that came out of transparency and accountability,\u201d says Romito. \u201cThe visibility of feedback both internal and external makes people behave better.\u201d For example, NAR\u2019s member profile shows that only 1 out of 5 sellers (1 out of 4 buyers) is contacted by his or her REALTOR\u00ae after the sale. Romito says; \u201cWhen we partner with agents, 90 percent of them follow up with clients after the sale.\u201d\n\nWhen a brokerage or agent opts into the program, QSC automatically generates and sends customer satisfaction surveys to REALTORS\u00ae\u2019 clients once the transactions close, then compiles the resulting data on a password-protected system where the brokerage can view survey results, ratings, and comments from clients. Consumers can see survey results on RatedAgent.com only if the agent opts to make them public in an all-or-nothing option\u2014the good reviews with the bad.\n\nRatedAgent.com, which has been live since early 2012, also lists in its \u201cFind an Agent\u201d database agents who have not yet been rated (or haven\u2019t made their reviews public) but have earned the company\u2019s Quality Service Certification professional designation.\n\nFor more on the program and joining the charter group of participants, contact Info@QualityCertified.org or call 888-547-4772.\n\n\"Reprinted with permission from REALTOR AE magazine, a publication of the National Association of REALTORS.\"",
