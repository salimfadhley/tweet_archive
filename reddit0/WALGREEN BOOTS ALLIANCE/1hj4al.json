  "selftext": "\nMonday Jul 01, 2013\n\nEngagement every day\n\nIn April, we held our third annual \u201cMy Walgreens My Voice\u201d survey by Gallup\u00ae.\u00a0 We had great participation this year, with 80% of all team members participating, and the results are in. So what did they show? \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe survey results show that we\u2019ve improved. Our overall Gallup\u00ae Grand Mean score was 4.04, up from 3.79 in 2012. And the score for our retail employees was 4.09, up from 3.80 last year.\u00a0 The percent of engaged employees in our stores increased to 53% from 38% last year, which is phenomenal! \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe results show we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u00a0 With the return of our Express Scripts patients and our partnerships with Alliance Boots and Amerisource Bergen, we\u2019ve laid the framework for future success. And we\u2019re past the half-way point with field transformation, so we have the right people and processes in place to transform the customer and employee experience in our stores. Gallup concluded that engaging our employees every day, through Store Walks and 5 minute meetings, is what\u2019s driving our significant improvement in team member engagement. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe areas where we saw the most improvement relate to the questions: \u201cSomeone has talked to me about my progress,\u201d \u201cI have received recognition for my work,\u201d and \u201cBest friend at work,\u201d where we went from a score of 3.15 to 3.73, a huge jump.\u00a0 With managers and team members having a clearer understanding of what a \u201cbest friend\u201d means \u2013 and that it\u2019s OK to have a friend at work \u2013 helped move that number. For the Walgreens-specific questions, the most significant improvement was in the question \u201cI am confident in my company\u2019s financial future,\u201d in which we moved from 3.51 to 4.19.\n\n\nFor the open-ended question (\u201cIf you had to make one change at our company to make it a better place to work, what would it be?\u201d), 110,000 team members responded, and the top themes were reported by Gallup\u00ae. The top comments were about improving scheduling, hours, and work-life balance, along with requests for more hours and overtime. Other top themes were better benefits and incentives, and improving morale and supporting employees. These are themes frequently seen here on the blog, and it shows there is some consistency across our organization regarding what matters to employees. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough some of the survey questions pertain to the company, many of the questions focus on your manager or supervisor. And that\u2019s the way it should be.\u00a0 Because in most cases, our team members aren\u2019t working for the company or for corporate; they\u2019re working for their store manager. Team members make a decision to stay with us based on their manager, not corporate. \u00a0The environment a manager builds will determine the level of talent and engagement they have in their store. As a young store manager I learned this the hard way; we didn\u2019t have engagement surveys back in those days. Now, our goal is to provide managers with the right tools and materials needed to lead and engage their teams. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll talk more about what we plan to do with this year\u2019s survey results, and how we plan to improve our team member experience across the company.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nStore managers were able to access their store\u2019s results this past week, and soon you\u2019ll have a meeting to review the results and to \u201caction\u201d plan what you can do as a team to improve the experience at your location. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThanks again to everyone who participated in this year\u2019s survey. I appreciate your participation and I appreciate your comments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBe well.\n",
