Today an elderly couple comes up. I ring them up and they hand me a reward card. Not our store reward card, just some sort of generic one. I'm fairly new and I'd never seen one, but it looks like a debit card so I have them swipe it.\n\nIt comes up with the standard debit card screen, so I ask them to enter the PIN. Then, the following exchange happened.\n\nEC: We don't have a PIN.\nMe: It's possible you have to run it as credit, then. Just hit 'Cancel.'\nEC: But it's a debit card!\nMe: Then I'll need you to enter a PIN.\n\nThat exchange repeated almost verbatim about three times. Then after muttering how \"that nice lady over there (my manager) let me do it without a PIN last time. You changed the rules on me.\" my manager came over and told me, loud enough for him to hear, to run it as credit.\n\nI showed him where the Credit button was at, and after that, he smiled smugly at me and said, \"I told you it was a debit card.\"\n\nAfter I made him click the button that said \"Credit\" in 48 point font.\n\nSigh.",
