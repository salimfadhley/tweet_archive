  "selftext": "So, I replaced my HDD with a SSD a couple of weeks ago.  Then, I noticed that my CPU was running quite hot, and decided to freshen up my thermal paste.  In the process, I managed to drop the CPU after \"taking it out to get it really clean\".  Well, dropping CPUs has a tendency to bend pins.  Clumsy oafs that drop CPUs have a tendency to break pins when they try to \"gently\" bend them back (using a variety of strategies I learned from the internet).\n\nWelllllll, to make a long story short, I had to buy a new CPU.  Imaged my Windows 7 install, put in the new CPU, and I am ready to go!  I am really blazing now with the SSD and thermal pasted CPU.\n\nAbout a week later, I get a friendly message from my Genuine Windows Experience that my legitimately purchased Windows 7 Ultimate won't activate.  I try various methods, but, no, it's not happening.  Finally, as a last step, I reach out to the Answer Desk.  I am connected to Michael N.  We go through the procedures, and Michael and I come to the conclusion that I have a few lingering activations that are zombies because they're tied to old hardware configs that have been replaced over the years.  Michael also informs me that my product is outside the warranty period, and I will have to purchase tech support from the Answer Desk.\n\nIt's $99 to resolve one issue.  I'll just leave that there.\n\nUbuntu is free.  Or, I can pirate a Win 7 key, but I really like being legit now that I'm not a poor college student.  I don't really want to go all out Ubuntu because I'm just not proficient yet.  But, damn, Michael, you're making it really hard on me.  He won't budge.  It's either $99 to fix my zombie keys, or I can buzz off.  He's a \"by the book kind of guy,\" I guess.\n\nWell, I ask Michael if he can give me a link to buy additional activation keys from M$.  \"No, but if you enroll in our support, I can fix your issue.\"  I responded by linking to Newegg where I can get an OEM for $99.  \"That's not from a Microsoft WEBSITE,\" Michael says.  \"I know that.  But for $99, I can just solve this problem myself (strongly implying that M$ isn't getting $99 either way).\"  \n\n\"But you don't have to go to another website.\"\n\n\"I know, Michael.  I can pay you $99 to fix the problem.  Or I can do it myself for $99.\"\n\n\"Yes, we can certainly resolve your issues.  Would you like to enroll?\"\n\n\"For you to fix this one issue, for $99?  No.  I would not. I might just.....(install Ubuntu and eff you M$, but I didn't get that out because Michael terminated our session)\"\n\nWTF, Michael N.?\n\nSo, I think for a few minutes, browse around a few websites to see what Windows 7 will cost me because I can't buy it direct from M$ (hint, don't be idiots about this, let people buy the product they want to buy from you direct so you can make $).\n\nIn the end, I decided that I would try the Answer Desk again.  I get a different guy.  I tell him what's going on, how part of my computer thinks it's the \"Genuine Windows Experience\" and another part thinks I've stolen the keys to the Hindenburg.  I'm anticipating all of his Q&amp;A from Michael's BS, but Merrell takes it a different direction. Merrell asks me a new question....now I don't know what to do.  I'm prepared to be a jerk, but Merrell seems interested in a new tactic.\n\nSo, I give Merrell the info he wants, and he comes back with something for me to try.  A code.  It works.  I'm activated.  IN 5 MINUTES.  I spent 10 minutes screwing with Michael because all he wanted was for me to enroll in their tech support plan.  But Merrell....Merrell was the bomb.  Merrell didn't screw around and waste my time.  He got my issue resolved, and my Windows activated.\n\nMerrell also advised me to save a copy of the code because he listened when I told him I change out my hardware fairly often.  Merrell fixed my issue, and I told him he was awesome.  I tried to leave feedback, but the M$ feedback link kept eating itself.  I did give him a ( ^ _ ^ ) -b for being awesome, and I also told him Michael N was a nutsack (which is true).\n\nI also told Merrell that I was putting him on reddit for being awesome, and a good example of how a good tech support interaction can make a huge difference.  I know M$ sucks, but if I paid for something, help me use it.\n\nDON'T ENCOURAGE ME TO PIRATE WHEN I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU MONEY.  \n\nM$'s Answer Desk had one job to do.  Keep paying customers legit.  Maybe I wouldn't buy the tech support plan, but if I had made the switch to Ubuntu for real you'd never get me back.  I hate Win 8, but I might not have hated Win 9.  Michael N blew it.  Merrell saved the day.\n\nI told Merrell I hope he got to the front page.  I have an image link, but the rules say I can't post it.  Maybe I'll do it in the comments below.  I don't care about the karma, but I do care that Merrell knows that being decent kicks a lot more ass than being a nutsack like Michael N.  And Michael N., if you see this, hope your boss doesn't.  Sticking to the script isn't always the right answer.  Sometimes, being human is.",
