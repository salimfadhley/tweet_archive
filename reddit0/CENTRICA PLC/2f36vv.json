Maybe they'll tell me I'm wrong, or I'm missing a trick, etc.\n\nCurrently I hold about 37% of my portfolio in ARM, 37% in Glencore, 25% in Schroeders, and the rest (1%) in Centrica.\n\nI'm planning to add approx 4% a month, split evenly across Next, BP, Mondi PLC and British Land Corp.\n\nWhy these?\nIn general - diversification.\n\nNext has been on a steady multi-year rise, and with their stores continually getting more popular, I can't help but feel that there's a reasonable long term upside to them.\n\nBP - I Think they're riding through their rough times now and I think theres maybe a 10-15% upside in the next few months to them\n\nMondi - pure speculation, I know very little about them, but they seem to be on quite a steady increase.\n\nBritish Land - similar reasons to Mondi and Next\n\nWould really appreciate someone discussing a bit with me, sharing tips perhaps, etc.\n",
