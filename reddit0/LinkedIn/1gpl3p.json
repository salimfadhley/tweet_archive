You can find [that list on pastebin here](http://pastebin.com/uc2JXPfB).\n\n**update** I just ran that again against ns1.linkedin.com and the Google nameservers and there are still around 90 domains pointing to the 204 server.\n\n**edit** I might have mixed up some of the IP addresses here, I got a message on twitter that the 204.11 IP is a DDoS mitigation service. but then a DDoS mitigation server would look almost identical to an intercepting proxy. There is nothing else on that IP that links it back to a known service, so far.",
