  "selftext": "This actually happened yesterday, so it's relatively fresh \n\nRight, so at the moment I am at Disney world Orlando with my dad and little sister. My sister is 10 and I am 17. As my sister is a dumbass and can't walk in a straight line as she is looking at all the Disney shenanigans, I sometimes put my hand on her back and guide her through the crowds.\n\nNow the fuck up:\nWe are walking in a big crowd towards the haunted mansion and I see my sister walking the wrong way so without really paying attention I again start guiding her for a few minutes. When we get to the haunted mansion I look down and realise, that's not my sister. she was wearing similar clothes and looked similar but this was definitely not my sister. Fuck. That's also when my dad noticed. I had managed to lose my sister, and kidnap someone else's daughter at the same time.\n\nLuckily ad Disney they are used to lost kids, petrified parents and confused siblings/ child thief's and managed to find the girls parents. And sadly, they found my sister too.\n\nTl:Dr went to Disney.  Saw sister. Kidnapped a little girl. \n\nEdit: haunted mansion not haunted house\n\nWow okay this has blown up, I'm glad you are all enjoying my sisters misfortunes.\n\n\nNarrated \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki6PH8Dnz7k&amp;feature=youtu.be",
