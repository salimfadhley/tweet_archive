  "selftext": "I hear some people having some doubts about the price lately: \"Is $500 a bit high? After all it was only around $100 just a year ago, right?\"\n\nOK, so let's take a step back and make a more thorough analysis: let's imagine Bitcoin was just a payment system. It's actually much more than that in my opinion since it is also a great store of value, but I will just assume it's a payment system for the sake of this demonstration.\nThis is a payment system that allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to accept payments across the Internet without having to open a bank account, just by embedding a piece of code in their website. In addition, they can start making commerce without having to give a big chunk of their earnings to bankers in commissions and fees.\nWhat would the value of this payment system be if it was a publicly listed company? Right now the total market cap of Bitcoin is $6.6 billion.\nSo let's compare that to other publicly listed companies in the payment industry:\n\n* Ebay (about to be renamed Paypal Inc): $68.8B\n* Mastercard: $88.5B\n* Discover: $28B\n* Western Union: $9.3B\n* Square: $5B ([Source](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c1acc3dc-7d48-11e3-a579-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3BEoWjWIp))\n\nAnd to compare with other random companies just for the fun of it:\n\n* Yahoo: $37.8B\n* Netflix: $28.8B\n* Yelp: $6B\n* Groupon: $4.2B\n\nHow does that look to you when compared to the $6.6B market cap of Bitcoin?\nAnd let's keep in mind that when you own stocks of a publicly traded company, you also own the fact that it has to pay for the multi-million dollar compensation for the executives, that new shares can be created out of thin air thereby dilluting you holding, compliance expenses etc... With Bitcoin, you own the real thing.\nAnd again, this is only talking about Bitcoin as a payment processor. If you add all the other remarkable features on top of it, well... I let you do the math.",
