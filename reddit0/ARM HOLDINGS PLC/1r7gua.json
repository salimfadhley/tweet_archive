This is my current understanding.\n\n- A US citizen cannot hold non-US mutual funds since they are treated as PFIC with onorous filing requirements.\n- Using a UK Stocks and Shares ISA (tax free wrapper) maybe OK for individual stocks (but may still trigger PFIC). But no funds - an ISA cannot hold non-UK mutual funds (and since it is invisible to the IRS holding any UK funds would trigger PFIC requirements)\n- I cannot contribute to a Roth IRA since I am married filing separately (wife is NRA) and earn more than $10,000.\n- A UK tax payer is taxed punitively on foreign funds that are not listed with \"distributor status\" [here](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/offshorefunds/dist_fundlist.htm)\n\nGiven that I do not want to maintain a portfolio of individual stocks, but want to use passive funds, what options are open to me?\n\nI accept that I will have to forgo any tax-advantaged accounts. I have a regular Interactive Brokers account and I guess the best thing I can do is hold US mutual funds in there. I would like to use passive Vanguard type funds, but I need to find ones that are US based, but with distributor status in the UK. I wondered if anyone here might be in a similar situation or be able to help with a list of funds that satisfy these requirements. \n\nAs far as I can tell the Vanguard funds listed in the HRMC list are from the \"international\" arm of Vanguard (Vanguard PLc) and so are probably not US domiciled funds. Are there other companies with a range of passive funds that would be worth looking at.\n\n\n\n",
