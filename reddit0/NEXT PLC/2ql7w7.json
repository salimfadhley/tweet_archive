  "selftext": "I'm applying for PLC Sophomores hopefully for this years class, made it through MEPS with no waivers needed, in the honors program of my university, plenty of EC's/leadership positions held, but I think I've made a huge mistake in the process. I've finished the whole application, have LORs from the Dean of my college, employer, two retired Colonels in the Marine Corps and a retired Major, all that, but I still haven't taken my PFT or even had the chance to meet with the OSO. My recruiter had told me the selection boards were January, April and May but now I'm hearing it was in December? That's question one, question two is, I know I fucked up by not meeting with my OSO, I work odd hours throughout the week and have a tough time scheduling anything and the OSO office is 70 miles away, but that's not an excuse for my incompetence, just a hinderence. I know this is what I want to do with my life, even if it means going the enlisted route, but if I could just get any advice on what I need to do next. I've already sent an email to my recruiter, but if someone can clarify when the boards are (I'm afraid I missed the first board, and its looking like I'll have to either apply through to PLC Juniors or enlist) and what the next course of action I should take is. Thanks all.",
