I&#39;ve seen some awesome stuff here, and after having taking quite the liking to wet shaving, I finally found something of my own to pick up.  </p>\n\n<p>I was in Vegas for a few days and visited the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop of History Channel&#39;s &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; fame. Just toured around to look a cool stuff like a good lemming, but came across this <a href=\"http://imgur.com/ATRAul9.jpg\">http://imgur.com/ATRAul9.jpg</a> for $40 and I couldn&#39;t pass it up. The best information they could give me is that it is a &quot;Colgate and Co Shaving Kit from some time in the 40s.&quot; It&#39;s not in the greatest condition, but I thought it was pretty awesome, and didn&#39;t even know Colgate had made shaving products that far back. </p>\n\n<p>I am wondering if anyone here may have more information!  </p>\n\n<p>For that, I have included a picture of the whole set (above), the front/closed box <a href=\"http://imgur.com/iDu1E2b.jpg\">http://imgur.com/iDu1E2b.jpg</a>, canister close-up <a href=\"http://imgur.com/uB704Hm.jpg\">http://imgur.com/uB704Hm.jpg</a> (it reads &quot;Colgate and Co Shaving Stick // New York U.S.A.&quot;), and the razor undone <a href=\"http://imgur.com/NMTtu5i.jpg\">http://imgur.com/NMTtu5i.jpg</a>.    </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I know that Arko shave sticks and (fittingly) Palmolive shave sticks take the shape of these canisters, but I have never used one - how do I go about using a stick of soap when I put it into one of these canisters? Also - my girlfriend thinks the green insides <a href=\"http://imgur.com/UUV0HZy.jpg\">http://imgur.com/UUV0HZy.jpg</a> are from leftover soap scum - any idea how to clean these? I also suspect it may be some sort of tarnish/oxidation, but I don&#39;t know what metal these are made of (low% silver/nickel is my guess).  </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, a picture of the new razor with the one I started with <a href=\"http://imgur.com/lMIAb14.jpg\">http://imgur.com/lMIAb14.jpg</a> and a picture with the whole family <a href=\"http://imgur.com/weIghhL.jpg\">http://imgur.com/weIghhL.jpg</a>, both with a credit card for scale.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks guys!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
