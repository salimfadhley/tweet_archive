This obviously did damage to my engine. I contacted the insurance company and got the car in the shop.\nIt took over a month before anyone from the insurance company to come assess the damage, and then almost another month before they turned in the report. I was told the amount of the damages and my deductible (1000$) and was told how long it would take to fix. I went to pick up my car and THE ENTIRE FRONT BODY of the car had been replaced. The insurance person thought the damage to my car was the scratch it had on the sides, which had actually occurred 4 years earlier and had no effect on the performance of the vehicle. I sit in the body shop for a few hours talking to several people from my insurance company before they eventually verbally agree that they messed up and that they will fix the damage to my car from the accident.\nI get a call back a few weeks later saying that all of the damage to my engine was caused by normal wear and tear and none of it was a direct cause of the accident, so they will not be covering ANY of the expenses.\nThe damages they were referring to were some cracked/ripped lines (ok, I know that was done in the accident, but maybe time made them more brittle and easy to break so w/e I&#39;ll cover those), my coolant pump (WHICH I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE BREAKS FROM A FRONT END COLLISION) and damage to my oil pan(? or something like that) which is consistent with undercarriage trauma. Oh, did I forget to mention that I had JUST had the car in the shop about a month before the accident and had DRIVEN the car that day with NO engine problem notifications, and then suddenly, the first time I turn the car on after the accident it says the engine is overheating and that the oil is low?\nSo my insurance company is trying to weasel out of fixing damage to my car after I&#39;ve already paid a deductible and now can still NOT DRIVE my shiny new looking car (which I never asked nor insinuated that I cared about it looking shiny and/or new). I have contacted them, but I can not get anyone on the phone that can actually do something about my situation. My problem at this point is that I have no idea what to do next.\nI assume contact a lawyer and also get the car looked at by a professional not affiliated with the insurance company to corroborate that the damages are IN FACT consistent with the accident. Does anyone know what kind of rights I have here? Does anyone have any suggestions of who to contact? This happened in June and the insurances companies feet dragging has made me unable to drive my car (which I&#39;m still paying insurance for) until now, the beginning of October and they are basically saying that I&#39;m f<strong><em>ed. I&#39;m in Georgia.\nPlease someone help me :( I wasn&#39;t even the person driving the car (and yes my insurance covers other people driving my car) so this whole thing is just completely f</em></strong>ed up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
