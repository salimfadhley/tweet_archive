  "selftext": "It's going to be insanity tonight at http://mlg.tv/playcevo and you can catch all the action live, casted by the great Dust Mouret and myself.\n\nWe'll start off the evening with Cloud9 vs. Luminosity ( http://csgolounge.com/match?m=3310 ) at 8:00PM EST. Cloud9 recently dropped longtime staple Semphis, as well as their AWPer Shahzam, and picked up Freakazoid and - sadly for Hiko - Skadoodle, who many consider to be NA's top AWPer. With this change, it's hard to argue that Cloud9 does not keep its position at the top of the NA scene, but LG will be looking to dispute that point. LG has made some huge investments of their own recently, picking up Swedish player pyth and grabbing ptr, who was dropped from CLG. With the addition of a great (sometimes) AWPer and some Euro firepower, who knows, maybe LG has what it takes to start off the HUGE Season 7 of CEVO with a bang against the perennial NA favourites at C9. Worth noting is that there is talk that ABE will be playing tonight for LG instead of pyth. How will this impact their chances? If they can pull out a victory all the same, the message sent will be a strong one.\n\nCLG goes up against SKDC later in the night, following the game above ( http://csgolounge.com/match?m=3311 ). SKDC...I mean, has SKDC won a game in the last year? It feels like fans of this team like myself are stuck with \"what if\"s and perpetually left wondering why a team with so much potential just can't seem to pull it together. They'll be fighting CLG, who have dropped their AWPer ptr due to his lagging performance of late. Last night they tried out jdm and he played pretty well, but it's unclear if he will pull a Michael Jordan and come out of retirement for the umpteenth time to stick around with CLG. Will they try out jdm again tonight, or try somebody new? NA has precious few AWPers to choose from, but some big names come to mind that have been in the news lately. Maybe they'll just play with 4 and still beat poor SKDC, who just can't catch a break.\n\nOnly one thing is for sure, folks. The NA shuffle continues and, whoever plays tonight, these guys are going to be playing their hearts out, because if ever there was a time in their careers to make an impact, it would be right now. Are we starting to see some solid sides that will stick together for a while, or are there still big moves to be made? Is NA any closer to catching up to EU once the dust settles? What of the high skilled players without teams currently? We will definitely come closer to finding the answers to those questions and more tonight, and you can watch all the action at http://mlg.tv/playcevo",
