In addition, a survey of 2,000 men was undertaken to examine their attitudes to emotion and whether they say how they really feel.\nThe Emotional Experiment\nThe study was conducted by Mindlab, an independent company which specialises in scientific research in the fields of physiological and neurological studies.\nIn the experiment, a group of 30 participants (15 fathers and 15 mothers) were presented with a series of images and videos, while their physiological responses were measured via skin conductance electrodes attached to their fingers.\nThe content they were presented with was categorised into four topics; blissful, funny, exciting and heart-warming. Men demonstrated a marginally higher emotional reaction to the blissful, funny and exciting content, compared to the women.\nHowever, the experiment found that men responded twice as strongly as women with higher levels of physiological emotion when presented with heart-warming content. The men\u2019s emotional reactions significantly spiked when they watched a video of a solider coming home from war and reuniting with his daughter.\nAs part of the experiment, participants also had to rate the content on a questionnaire to say how it made them feel. As expected, women said they felt more emotional in response to the content compared to the men. However, even though men reported feeling less emotion than women, their physiological changes showed that in fact they felt emotion more strongly.\nNeuropsychologist Dr David Lewis said: \u201cGender stereotypes about men being stoic and women being emotional are reinforced by our day to day consumption of media and our social interactions.\n\u201cWe tend to oversimplify and exaggerate the perceived differences between men and women and are more likely to focus on evidence that supports our existing gender stereotypes.\n\u201cThis study suggests that men feel emotion just as much as women, sometimes more strongly, but are less willing to express these emotions openly due to expectations put on them by society.\u201d\nHow to move your Dad this Father\u2019s Day\nRoyal Mail is publishing a list of the ultimate phrases to write in a Father\u2019s Day card that have been scientifically shown to move dads.\nA number of commonly written messages were presented to the fathers in the experiment with their emotional reactions measured.\nThe definitive list of phrases to write in a Father\u2019s Day card that will tug at fathers\u2019 heart strings:\nNumber One Dad\nYou\u2019re my favourite person in the whole world \nI love you \nYou\u2019re the best\nThanks for everything you\u2019ve done for me\nSurvey reveals men\u2019s attitudes to emotion\nIn addition to the experiment, a survey of 2,000 men was carried out to understand their attitudes to emotion and whether they say how they really feel. Surprisingly, the poll found over two thirds (67%) said they thought men were secretly more emotional than they appeared.\nThe younger generation are more comfortable with expressing their emotions with 40% of 18-24 year olds saying they had cried in the last week. Meanwhile, 43% of men aged 25-34 years-old openly discuss their emotions.\nDespite the stereotype of a man caring more about their football team than their partner, only one in eight admit to crying over sport.\nOxford may be home to the most emotional men in the country with 87% saying they feel emotional or extremely emotional when their child says \u2018I love you\u2019,\nAlmost half of men in Plymouth (48%) are most likely say \u2018I love you\u2019 more than once per day, compared to men in Manchester who admitted they say \u2018I love you\u2019 less than once a month (26%), their top answer.\nOver two thirds of men (64%) say they were surprised at how much emotion they felt when their child was born, with 7 in 10 men in Leicester affected the most.\nStephen Agar from Royal Mail said: \u201cWhat our research has shown is that underneath a stereotype of a tough exterior, men are really emotional but they don\u2019t like to admit it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created an ultimate list of phrases that have been scientifically proven to move dads and really pull at their heart strings. We hope this helps our customers when writing and sending their Father\u2019s Day cards, and we expect there to be a lot of emotional dads across the UK come Sunday.\u201d\nNote to editors\nThe study addressed the question of whether men and women feel similar levels of emotion in response to different types of positive emotional stimuli. Fifteen fathers and fifteen mothers watched four blocks of emotional videos and images and then rated them on how emotional, how positive, and how exciting they were on a seven point scale. The four blocks consisted of exciting, funny, heart-warming and blissful stimuli.\nParticipants\u2019 skin conductance was measured throughout to examine their automatic, physiological emotional response. Skin conductance is measured using two electrodes attached to the fingers and is a measure of physiological emotion which is outside of conscious control.\nThe stimuli:\nBlissful \u2013 images of children and animals sleeping, images of adults relaxing. Videos of a man doing Tai Chi, a women doing yoga, waves breaking on a beautiful beach, and a turtle swimming in the sea.\nExciting \u2013 images of adults doing extreme sports; children (e.g. skating, etc.); animals (e.g. a cheetah running). Videos of Felix Baumgartner jumping to earth from space, a gymnast flying on bars, a person doing a wingsuit jump, extreme snowboarding, and free running.\nFunny \u2013 images of adults, children and animals doing funny things. Videos were \u2018You\u2019ve been Framed\u2019 type videos and animals causing mischief.\nHeart-warming \u2013 images of children and animals cuddling and looking cute, adults in love, etc. Video of a soldier coming back from war surprising his daughter, unlikely animal friendships such as a lion and deer, and a video of a lion and trainer meeting again after decades apart\nThe research for Royal Mail was carried out online by Mindlab between 22 / 05/ 2014 and 28 / 05 / 2014 amongst a panel resulting in 2001 men in the UK. Participants were recruited using the online survey company One Poll.\nMedia Enquiries\nSimon Feldman\nPR Manager (Campaigns)\n0207 449 8246/07435 769 017\nsimon.feldman@royalmail.com\nAbout Royal Mail plc\nRoyal Mail plc is the parent company of Royal Mail Group Limited, the leading provider of postal and delivery services in the UK and the UK\u2019s designated universal postal service provider.
