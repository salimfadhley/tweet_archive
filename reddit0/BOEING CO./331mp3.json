Anyone do a co-op at Google, Amazon, Nividia, Boeing ? \n\nFor those of you who graduated, did you get offers from top level employers or apply and get offered a job. \n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies, really! I was unsure about going to UBC engineering. But all of you have shown me there is lots of opportunities with a UBC engineering degree. \n\nAs well, I don't mean any disrespect to those who don't work at any of the companies I mentioned. Of course money is not everything, I just mentioned some companies I wanted to work for in the future and thought were highly ranked employers. ",
