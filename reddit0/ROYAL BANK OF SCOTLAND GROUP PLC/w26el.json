  "title": "RBS is about to be fined $233 million for its role in the Libor-rigging scandal. The bank is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer and is said to have no power to claw back bonuses from the traders responsible. So the bank is fined for robbing taxpayers via Libor, and the fine is paid by the taxpayer."
