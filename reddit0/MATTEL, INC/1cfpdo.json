  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently doing the \"Media Studies Project\" Capstone Unit, and I am doing a social media plan to help existing Lilydale students (and new students) get used to the new surroundings at Hawthorn.\n\nNow sure, I know a campus map is going to be the first point - but what things do you think Lilydale students should know about?\n\nIs there a bad block of toilets? Is there a room which has annoying flickering lights? Is there a main area for smokers? Any cool stuff? Where's the good cafes? etc etc\n\nI've had units at Hawthorn myself, but I need to know some nitty gritty. Stuff you wouldn't otherwise find out on the Swinburne site.\n\nThanks for your help in advance. I'll let you know how this assignment goes.",
