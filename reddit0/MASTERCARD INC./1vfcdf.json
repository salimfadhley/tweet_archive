  "selftext": "Hello! :)\n\nI am launching a new network of websites that offer medicine in return for bitcoin. I have several years experience running an online pharmacy. To start off with I accepted PayPal, then Visa/Mastercard and finally just Bank Transfer. Sadly PayPal and Visa/Mastercard are very aggressive in their desire to stop the sales of medicine with their payment facilities. Bank Transfers are okay, but they are slow and very expensive (Often costing $25~ per transfer to the customer). So I have been left with many reliable suppliers, efficient backend systems and no way to accept payments... but my good friend has told me about Bitcoin and he says it should make things possible again. I have done my research, had websites built and I am looking forward to seeing if people who desire medicine are people who are saavy enough to grasp the bitcoin payment system too - I guess we will find out :-D\n\nHere's how it works... The prices are all listed for Generic Provigil. The brand you will be receiving is 200mg Modalert which is manufactured by Sun Pharmaceuticals. The prices on my website are listed as both USD and BTC. To be clear - the USD price is fixed and the BTC price is calculated live using the latest BTC price. Prices are as follows:\n10 Tablets for $40 US (inc EMS Express Shipping) - approx 0.051 BTC at time of this post\n40 Tablets for $59 US (inc EMS Express Shipping) - approx 0.074 BTC at time of this post\n100 Tablets for $99 US (inc EMS Express Shipping) - approx 0.124 BTC at time of this post\n200 Tablets for $179 US (inc EMS Express Shipping) - approx 0.223 BTC at time of this post\n\nTo see the latest prices or place an order please visit the website: http://www.provigil4bitcoins.com/\n\nThis is one of my first posts on Reddit so please be gentle with me. The reason I am writing this post on /r/afinil is two-fold. Firstly, I am a 'n00b' in the area of bitcoin and I would really appreciate your feedback if there is anything I could do to improve my adoption of this currency on my website. Secondly, I'm hoping that some of the people reading this might be looking for Modafinil and decide to place an order sometime soon :)\n\nIf you have questions, please send me a Message or leave a comment on this thread. You can also reach me via email: info@stuff4bitcoins.com\n(You will find my PGP key at the bottom of my home page -> www.stuff4bitcoins.com )\n\nP.S. Looking for Nuvigil / Armodafinil instead? I've got that too: www.nuvigil4bitcoins.com",
