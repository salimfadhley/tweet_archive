Everyone gets upset having to wait 20-40 minutes for their cars, then when they finally get it they all migrate to the nearest restaurant a block away for breakfast/brunch [and can't find a parking space].\n\nNormally, we have 4-12 valets on, but for checkout we may have upwards of 30 or more.  It's still physically impossible to deliver all the cars to the lobby.  It simply can't be done.  Our parking lot is 20 acres, but our hotel courtyard only holds about 20 cars.\n\nThe seasoned pros check out much earlier, or they come to our station and tell us their plan.  We are grateful - we will not charge any extra for leaving your car for an hour after checkout.\n\nSo pack up.  Put your stuff in the Concierge's storage area, go for breakfast/coffee/sightseeing, and come back at 11 for your car.  You'll enjoy your morning and our department won't get reamed out.\n\n",
