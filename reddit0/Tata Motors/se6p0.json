The contributing measures to this outstanding performance is the sharp spurt in Evoque sales and beter than expected performance of its Jaguar portfolio.\n\nIn addition the 50 bps repo rate cut undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was better than street expectations and signals the end of the rising interest rate scenario. So this should be significantly positive for the Tata Motors domestic business also.\n\nBased on our Sum of the parts valuation method we raise Tata Motors Ltd. expected target price to Rs 338 (previous 292). Please find the Tata Motors update for the revised numbers.\n\nAlso attached is a detailed Initiating covergae report on Tata Motors for reference.",
