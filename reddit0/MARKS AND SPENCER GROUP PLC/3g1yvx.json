But I have told him firmly every time I catch him doing it to please stop and that it makes me uncomfortable. BUT HE STILL DOES IT. I don&#39;t really know who to talk to about this, or if it&#39;s even a thing to talk about. It&#39;s awkward and uncomfortable but it seems silly/immature. But then I turn around and see a grown man crouching to lick my elbow and I just about lose my shit. It happens every time we work together, 3+ times a day.
