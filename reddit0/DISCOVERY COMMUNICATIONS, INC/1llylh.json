I'm just a normal husband and father of 3 that likes to learn, and kind of takes it to an extreme level.  \n\nHere's my YouTube Channel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/smartereveryday\nI'm currently working on the [100th Smarter Every Day episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhFyEzOnLWw). I figured timing was probably right for this if people are interested.\n\nI'd be honored to be given the opportunity **to earn** your subscription.  Subscribers are typically inquisitive types that are open to the idea of a guy from Alabama doing cool science.\n\nI have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and an MS in Aerospace Engineering with a concentration in Rocket Propulsion.  I'm a full time Engineer and shoot these videos on my vacation time and edit them when my kids/wife are asleep (tonight I'm doing this AMA while they sleep).\n\nI'm in the passenger seat while Wayne drives us back home to Alabama from hunting in Mississippi.  Tethering on my phone, but have a few hours to respond to any questions.  I always thought if there was enough interest in me doing an AMA I'd make sure I could reply with video responses [on my second channel](http://www.youtube.com/funnereveryday) , but now seems like a good time.  Ask me anything.\n\n[My Proof Tweet](https://twitter.com/smartereveryday)\n\nAlso, [here's a low quality upload I just made on FunnerEveryDay, the second channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN_K_fgucTw)\n\n[Here's the Smarter Every Day Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Smarter-Every-Day/216515601715946?ref=tn_tnmn) I am really horrible at facebook, so please be gentle.\n\n**Some popular questions are (populating list real time)**\n\n* Lots of people are asking me about my faith with really really long questions.  Obviously it will take time to go through those so I'm going to put them off for a bit.\n\n* \"Where do you get the ideas?\" -[Answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1llylh/iama_guy_who_explores_the_world_and_makes_science/cc0jhtv)\n\n**EDIT** Just got home from Mississippi.  Let me kiss my wife and tuck my kids in bed then I'll be back at it hard.  I promise.\n\n**EDIT** Back.\n\n**EDIT** [Pie is happening](https://twitter.com/smartereveryday/status/374767137102913536)\n\n\n\n**Update** Yeah... 6:30 AM.  Back at it.  Neato, front page.  \n\n**Update** Just showed my wife how to login to Reddit.  She'll answer some as MrsPennywhistle.  I expect you to be gentlemen.\n\n\n**EDIT** Day 4.  Looks like I answered all the questions and all the PMs.  Thanks Reddit!  You're great!\n\n",
