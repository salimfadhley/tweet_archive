Some supermarkets sell Asian style noodles but the closest store to us that sells udon is about 30 minutes away.  I have no problem using instant ramen to make broth based dishes but it would have been lost in the creamy peanut sauce.  We wanted something more substantial. By using the food labs recipe with linguine we got perfectly chewy udon-ish style noodles. It&#39;s not perfect, but it is amazing how much different it tastes, looks and feels than pasta. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
