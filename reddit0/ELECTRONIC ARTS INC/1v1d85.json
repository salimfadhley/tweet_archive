But is anyone else still annoyed by the stupid overscan issues that the OS on the system can't deal with.\n\nThe fact that Hud elements and the like are virtually cut off because the system decides that it knows best is infuriating.\n\nLarge chunks of the screen are gone because instead of the console allowing me to calibrate it's video output it want's the TV to do it. Problem is my TV only allows me to Zoom not Unzoom.\n\nSince I haven't used the console a huge deal since launch it hasn't been a super issue. But deciding to pick up Forza and Peggle 2 when I launched Peggle 2 at the start menu literally 2/3rds of the 2013 Electronics Arts Inc is missing because of the huge overscan issues.\n\nIt really shouldn't be that hard for the console to have the option in the OS. I imagine for those with other TV's that can force it via TV it's annoying when you stop using the XBox and have to switch settings back.\n\nEDIT: Peggle 2 is pretty much broken for me with the Overscan issue since I can't see the ball catch bucket that moves along the bottom of the screen. YAY :(",
