Have you considered to do a &quot;Verdi reloaded&quot; or at least an arrangement of a piece from Verdi for the Apocalyptica&#39;s repertoire? Greetings from Colombia! Hope to see you here in this tour :*</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Hehe...Verdi is my favorite composer of them all...I&#39;m not sure should we do more of classical crossovers with Apo but I love playing Verdi&#39;s arias and melodies in some my solo concerts :)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/33dr7r/yo_i_am_perttu_from_apocalyptica_ask_me_anything/cqk4lm9?context=5\">Hi perttu this its my 5 question  You feel when you&#39;re on stage with all those people waiting for you music ?

Long-time fan, and Apocalyptica&#39;s been a &quot;gateway band&quot; for discovering a bunch of other great Finnish bands/artists, so kiitos paljon for that.  While music <em>is</em> important...what do you feel makes for a good director of opera (as opposed to other theatre forms), and which operatic directors do you like for their work? </a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">In opera most important for me is the music, beauty of music...therefore i dont even pay attention so much for setup or direction..I go so deep somewhere to my own musical dominion while listening to beautiful music, don&#39;t realize time and space.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/33dr7r/yo_i_am_perttu_from_apocalyptica_ask_me_anything/cqk2i94?context=5\">How come no nail ink so far this tour?  Can I paint your nails for you?</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">I always do stuff with feeling, maybe there has not been such feeling yet :)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><em>Last updated: 2015-04-25 16:22 UTC</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This post was generated by a robot!
