It's crowded and dirty\nand full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you\ngetting there?\"\n \n\"We're taking American Airlines,\" was the reply. \"We got a great\nrate!\"\n \n\"American Airlines?\" exclaimed the barber. \"That's a terrible\nairline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly\nand they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?\"\n \n\"We'll be at the downtown International Marriott.\"\n \n\"That dump? That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are\nsmall, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha\ndoing when you get there?\"\n \n\"We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the\nPope.\"\n \n\"That's rich,\" laughed the barber. \"You and a million other\npeople trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy,\ngood luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.\"\n \nA month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The\nbarber asked him about his trip to Rome.\n \n\"It was wonderful,\" explained the man, \"not only were we on time\nin one of American Airlines s brand new planes, but it was\noverbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and\nwine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28-year-old stewardess\nwho waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel -- it was great!\nThey'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job, and now it's\nthe finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they\napologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!\n\"\n \n\"Well,\" muttered the barber, \"I know you didn't get to see the\nPope.\"\n \n\"Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a\nSwiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope\nlikes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so\nkind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would\npersonally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the Pope\nwalked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he\nspoke a few words to me.\"\n \n\"Really?\" asked the barber. \"What'd he say?\"\n \nHe said, \"Where'd you get the shitty haircut? ",
