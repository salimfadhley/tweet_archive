I googled a bunch and found that it is a known issue with Samsung LCDs, namely that a capacitor on the power supply is rated with too low a voltage to last any longer than the warranty.  \n\nEasy enough to replace the capacitor and get the thing working again right?  No, Samsung refuses to provide a diagram of the tv's insides and makes the case a clamshell with hidden screws everywhere.  I had to break the stupid thing to get it open, all to replace a single component on the power supply.  Thankfully I was able to get the tv working again, after much frustration.  \n\nIt's this kind of hostility toward the customer that makes it so hard to do DIY repairs on consumer goods anymore; Samsung literally engineered this tv to break after the warranty expired, forcing any less tech savvy person to throw away perfectly good hardware (but for a single piece) and get an entirely new tv.  Samsung literally engineered a piece of garbage and rented it to me.  Fuck Samsung, and fuck any manufacturer that does this.  I want to tear out the corporate officers hearts and feed it to them.  \n\ne: Here are the instructions I followed, since so many people asked for them.  http://www.michaellivingston.com/samsung-monitor-repair/",
