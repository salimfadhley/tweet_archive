How do you know what you are eating? I mean I kinda got a hint that companies are not required to state the place where the meat got \"produced\", so how do you discern the shit from the good food? If I was going out to eat a pastrami sandwich, how would I know if it's the shitty meat or the good meat?\n\nThing is that here in europe we are pretty well protected as customers, at least here in Italy we are very hasty about closing production line if they don't respect the europe community guidelines. When we had the shitstorm on \"Bufala's Mozzarella\" they shut down everything and only when every facility got tested about dioxin I didn't see any mozzarella on market shelves. \n\nI'm not bashing you: we are not perfect, every now and then some ugly thruth comes to the surface (ammonia in the milk and tainted water for example only in the past year and in nothern Italy only) that puzzlez me is that (at least according to the movie) when shit surfaces nobody does anything and the consumer is not aware of nothing!\n\nI want to ask how much of \"Food Inc.\" is thruth and how much is hype?\nDo you feel safe eating random meat, either from the supermarket or from a random restaurant?\n\nThank you!\n\np.s. Bonus question: every time I see food and america I see fried shit.. is it really that prevalend? Is it really you preferred method of cooking?",
