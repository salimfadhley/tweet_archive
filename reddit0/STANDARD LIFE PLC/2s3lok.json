I went to College, twice; Graduated both times.  I went to University; spent two years there until I completely ran out of money.  I thought I was doing the &quot;right&quot; thing since my parents, guidance counselors, TV, society, and peers told me that that was the right thing to do and that it would secure a good life and future for me.  </p>\n\n<p>After school, I applied to every single engineering job I could find.  If Subway had a post for &quot;sandwich engineers&quot; I would apply.  I got the same response from everyone (if I even got a response), &quot;we&#39;re looking for someone with a little more experience&quot;.  So my standards started to drop over time.  I started to apply to jobs where I was more and more over-qualified.  I now work at a coffee shop, clothing store, and a warehouse with a bunch of convicts.  I&#39;m not joking.  I spent 6.5 years in school and I share the same wage and position with a guy who was in prison for 2.5 years.</p>\n\n<p>I am 27 years old now, and I am so in debt that I will NEVER pay it off.  I have nothing.  No assets, no credit, no future.  My bank has created a 27 year old man with nothing to care for, nothing to lose, and someone who is not concerned with consequences at all.  I work 7 days a week, twice a day, just to make $20 less than what I owe every month.  </p>\n\n<p>Where did I go wrong?  Sometimes I wish I had just said fuck school, and instead, party, travel, do drugs and just enjoy my life.  But instead, I chose to make an &quot;investment&quot; in my future.  </p>\n\n<p>I have two college diplomas in electronics engineering.  I specialized in robotics and automation.  I further specialized in PLCs (programmable logic controllers) for an entire year.  I went to university for chemical engineering later on and had to leave because of my financial situation.  It broke my heart, and now I am extremely angry.  I feel like I&#39;ve been lied to.  I feel like I&#39;ve been taken advantage of.  I feel like I fell for the most elaborate marketing ploy out there.  </p>\n\n<p>I have no cosigner on my student loan, and lately I&#39;ve been thinking that the only reason the bank is still making money off of me, is because I am still alive.  This has a pretty obvious solution that I do not want to follow through with, so I ran away about a year ago, and I was about 200 miles from the Mexican border before my family talked me into coming back home (I&#39;m from Canada).  I came back about a year ago.  Started picking apples, planting trees, and cleaning toilets just to make my loan payments.  Again, I tried to do the &quot;right&quot; thing.  </p>\n\n<p>Well, here I am again, with my backpack all packed up ready to disappear again.  I know there are other young people in the exact same position I am in, so I just thought I would put this out there.  I have to go back to work tomorrow morning at 4:30am.  I will probably go, but I can&#39;t guarantee that I will make it through the week before I take off again.   This made me feel a little better, thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
