  "selftext": "There's currently a thread at /r/libertarian titled \"Bernie Sanders believes in the wage gap myth.\"\n\nOne of the most frequent arguments against the wage gap is the idea that if the wage gap was real, corporations would take advantage of the untapped female talent pool to boost their productivity.  Since corporations aren't doing that, it means that the wage gap can't exist.\n\nThere are several problems with this argument.  First of all, it assumes that corporations have perfect omniscience and never make mistakes and never waste money on things they don't have to pay for.  Which is stupid.  But it's also *factually* incorrect, given that corporations are actually doing the thing that libertarians insist that corporations aren't doing.\n\nIntel recently invested $300 million into increasing workplace diversity.  Why?  Because there's a massive shortage of skilled tech workers, and women account for 51% of the world population.  If you find ways to make tech more female friendly, then you double the size of your potential talent pool.\n\nSo how do libertarians respond?  By claiming that the $300 million investment is actually unnecessary, and that Intel is wasting money on something that they don't need to pay for.  In other words:  The exact opposite of the premise they tried to use earlier.\n\nMany of them dismiss this as a PR stunt, rather than an actual attempt to recruit workers.  Here's the problem:  Most of Intel's customers are *other corporations*.  They're not trying to convince Joe Average Consumer to buy more Intel chips, they're trying to convince Samsung and Apple and IBM.\n\nIf corporations only care about price/performance than they don't like wasting money, then why in the world would they be swayed by a wage gap that's supposedly a myth?\n\nThen they move the goal post to insist that Intel is doing this so that PC/Tablet makers will switch to Intel chips and then use the diversity initiative to advertise their products.  Of course, they can't present a single advertisement where this actually happened.\n\nMoreover, most customers already know that electronics are made in Chinese factories with deplorable conditions.  So what evidence is there to support the idea that Intel creating a diversity initiative that isn't advertised anywhere would have any effect on sales?\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n1. There is no wage gap, because a wage gap implies that corporations are spending money on male employees that they don't need to be spending.  And corporations would never spend money that they don't have to spend.\n\n2. The Intel Diversity Initiative is a hoax, because it's just an example of Intel wasting money on female employees that they don't have to spend.\n\n3.  X can't be true, because then Y would happen.  But the fact that Y is happening is irrelevant, because we already know that X can't be true.\n\n4. When it comes to evaluating employees, corporations are 100% unbiased and objective, and they only care about price/performance.\n\n5. When it comes to CPUs and actual computing power, corporations are 100% biased and don't give a shit about price/performance at all.\n\n6. Intel is spending $300 million on a PR stunt that no one is bothering to advertise, because companies don't like wasting money.\n\nThis is what libertarians actually believe.",
