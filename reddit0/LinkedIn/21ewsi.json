Now on Twitter: [@gamejobslist](http://www.twitter.com/gamejobslist/)**\n\nThere are 419 jobs online now as of this posting, and it automatically adds about 25 new listings every day. The link is to a publicly-shared Google Doc, and I provide a link to download the latest spreadsheet so you can edit and filter it for your needs. To the best of my knowledge, there's nothing else like this out there, and people have responded very positively to it since I launched it recently.\n\nIf you think it's useful, I would sincerely appreciate it if you folks could spread the word around. :)\n\nFor those that are curious how it works, it's actually pretty neat! It\u2019s a spreadsheet that is continuously and automatically populated with job postings on LinkedIn from game companies I follow that are posting new positions. I use the wonderful task automation tool IFTTT and this recipe to create it: https://ifttt.com/recipes/126007-job-ads-to-a-google-spreadsheet\n\nThe way it works is that it automatically monitors all the game companies I personally follow on LinkedIn (~150 or so) that post jobs on LinkedIn, then automatically enters the data onto this spreadsheet. I let it run for a few days as an initial test to make sure that only game companies\u2019 jobs are getting posted and that the formatting is intact, and it seems to work just fine with virtually zero input from me.\n\nHope you enjoy!",
