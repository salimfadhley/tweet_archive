And to pre-empt you all: yes, [these guys are included](http://imgur.com/DOeakKQ). The Sinestro Corps is at its full power of 7,200 Sinestro Corpsmen plus all the Manhunters and the War World. *The Yellow Power Rings function as normal, so if the bearer dies, they find replacements in the Marvel Universe.*\n\nLet's do this.\n\n______\n\n**ROUND 1: XANDAR ABLAZE**\n\nThis is the opening salvo of the Sinestro Corps War. Xandar, home base to the proud and honorable Nova Corps, is the first target of the Sinestro Corps. Destroying Xandar will release enough energy to cause a power surge within the Fear Spectrum for the Anti-Monitor to capture and store as he energizes his Anti-Matter Wave. [300 Sinestro Corpsmen](http://imgur.com/AyI0nTL), notable Corpsmen include [Karu Sil](http://imgur.com/AyI0nTL) and [Bedovian](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100318115703/greenlantern/images/0/0b/BNBedovian.jpg), exit supraluminal travel and barge into the unaware [300 Nova Corpsmen](http://flyingninjakick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/marvel-comics-nova-corps-01.jpg) in Xandar. The other 200, including [Nova Prime](http://fightersgeneration.com/np8/mvc3u/new/3/nova1.jpg) and half the Centurions, are a system away. Alternate objective is to cause enough damage to the Nova Corps as to render them nonoperational for the immediate future.\n\n**ROUND 2: AERIE-AL ATTACK**\n\n[One thousand Sinestro Corpsmen](http://imgur.com/w9DdnEP), led by the fearsome [Arkillo](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/2313611-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_5.51.54_pm.png), descend upon the unaware Shi'ar throneworld of Chandilar. The objective here is to destroy Shi'ar leadership and supply lines.\n\n**ROUND 3: SKREEM FOR THE CORPS**\n\nAnother [thousand Sinestro Corpsmen](http://imgur.com/0DuwuPC) have the objective of crippling the Kree's naval forces on their home system and framing the Skrull for the deed.\n\n**ROUND 4: BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKRULL**\n\nThe Skrull, for some reason, are at heightened alert and are mustering forces to prepare for another war. In the Throneworld of the Skrull Empire, 500 Sinestro Corpsmen arrive with the objective of destroying as many Skrull worlds as possible. Oh [Ranx](http://imgur.com/GcOtqBW) is here.\n\n**ROUND 5: MARVEL EARTH**\n\n[SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKERS](http://imgur.com/jZ4aUpx). No foresight, no warning, The full might of the Sinestro Corps descends on Earth. The only response teams available are those normally situated on Earth. They can call back up from their more cosmic allies, but it may take considerable time for people who don't have rad surfboards to arrive.\n\n**ROUNDS 6 to 10: REWIND AND REPEAT**\n\nRepeat all scenarios respectively, but this time, make the Marvel sides aware of the situation. For the last Round in particular, one of the Illuminati receives a malfunctioning green power ring that can only spew whatever Oa knows. Assume it has enough info on the Sinestro Corps.
