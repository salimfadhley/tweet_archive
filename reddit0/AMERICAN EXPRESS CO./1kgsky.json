I know very little on the matter, and some of the names from the list I recognized (i.e. Fidelity) offered no information on their website about their 403(b) plans.\n\nThis is the list of vendors:\n\n* American Express Financial Advisors (Ameriprise)\n* American Funds Service Co.\n* Equivest (AXA Equitable)\n* Fidelity Investments\n* Galic (Great American Advisors)\n* Horace Mann Life Insurance Co.\n* New York Life\n* ING Northern Life Insurance Co. (Reliastar)\n* Putnam Investors\n* Vanguard\n\nI'm not sure which plans, if any of you might know, are reputable and/or low-cost.  I'm just trying to make sense of it and wanted to see if anyone knew a thing or two they could share before I decide on one of these.\n\nThanks!",
