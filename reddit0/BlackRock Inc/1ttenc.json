  "selftext": "Here's the short of it: I have a substantial amount in my 401k, as I've maxed it as often as possible.  We're limited in what funds we can allocate, and after readjusting about 18 months ago, my 2013 return currently stands at 20%+. \n\nI'm 30 and have no problem with the risk of pursuing an aggressive growth strategy, which is what I have been doing. \n\nMy current allocation is as follows and adds up to about 60% (the rest is out in the form of a loan):\n\n* 6.25% - BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund, Inc. - Investor A Class\n* 9.25% - Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Fund - Class A\n* 9.02% - Prudential Jennison Mid-Cap Growth Fund - Class A\n* 9.38% - DWS Small Cap Value Fund - Class A\n* 16.03% - MFS New Discovery Fund - Class R3\n* 8.22% - Thornburg International Value Fund - Class R4\n* 2.66% - Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund - Class A\n \nWhile pursuing aggressive growth, I'm looking to unload the Thornburg Value and Oppenheimer Developing markets.  They're grossly underperforming the rest of the portfolio, coming in at 14% and 7.4% YTD, whereas the rest of my funds are in the 25-34% range.  \n\nThe rest of what is available to me:\n\n* DWS Money Market Prime Series - DWS Cash Investment Trust - Class A\n* Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund - Class A\n* Loomis Sayles Investment Grade Bond Fund - Class A\n* Prudential High Yield Fund - Class R\n* PIMCO Real Return Fund - Class A\n* American Century One Choice In Retirement Portfolio - Class A\n* American Century One Choice 2015 Portfolio - Class A\n* American Century One Choice 2025 Portfolio - Class A\n* American Century One Choice 2035 Portfolio - Class A\n* American Century One Choice 2045 Portfolio - Class A\n* Janus Balanced Fund - Class S\n* Nuveen Dividend Value Fund - Class A\n* American Funds Fundamental Investors Fund - Class R3\n* DWS S&P 500 Index Fund - Class A\n* DWS Alternative Asset Allocation Fund - Class A\n\nMy intentions were to pick up the Nuveen, American Funds Fundamentals, and S&P 500 index, reallocate half to the top 3 performing funds (Currently MFS New Discovery, DWS Small Cap, and since the rest are pretty close, the Blackrock Capital Appreciation, for diversity), leaving the other half to the rest.\n\nAny suggestions here?\n\n\n\n",
