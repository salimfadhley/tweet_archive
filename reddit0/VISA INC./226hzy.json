I ring up all of her products and we proceed to payment. I asked her if she wanted to pay cash, or electronically, she wants to do it electronically. After I told her to go ahead, she pulled out a Visa card, which immediately raised a red flag. Our store doesn't accept credit cards at all, because we don't carry anything that's more expensive than \u20ac100,- Also, unlike the US, paying with a credit card is not a common thing, we're used to using debit cards instead for day to day purchases. \n\nHowever, the American woman informs me that it is in fact a Visa **debit card** and wants to proceed. I never had seen one before, but they seem to be a thing. But, I once again had to tell her that she won't be able to pay with it. This time because it lacks a chip on the front. \n\nThis was put into place to prevent the rampant skimming. All stores block off the magnet reader on their debit card terminals, forcing you to use the chip. This means you can only use your card by inserting it into the terminal, not swiping it.

Well, I ain't stopping her, so I allow her to. She sticks her card into the terminal.... Aaaaand nothing, shocker. Defeated, she pulls out her card and hands me cash, I hand over her change and wish her a nice stay in the Netherlands.\n\nSometimes you just have to let them have it their way.\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm aware that you have your own credit/debit card, but if I tell you you can't use it, please believe me.\n\n**Edit:** There appears to be some confusion about the card that was used.
