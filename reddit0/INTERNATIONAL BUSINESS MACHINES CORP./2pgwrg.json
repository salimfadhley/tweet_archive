  "selftext": "\n**TL;DR**\n\n**Irish guy, sick of Irish life, doesn't see a future here (depressive thoughts) and wants out. Words of encouragement encouraged.**\n\nI was going to post on /r/iwantout but they don't seem to appreciate negativity. Also my desire to emigrate is not so much of a want, but more of need at this stage.\n\nI'm 25 and currently living in Ireland. A lot of people are fascinated with this country. We get a lot of tourists and that is great. I'd advise anyone to come and visit for a couple of weeks because the people here will be very friendly. It is sort of built into the heritage of the Irish people to respect and welcome visitors. \n\nBut I also see a lot of people on the internet that seem to be desperate to move here and live here. But this country and this society is not all that you think it is. I have reached breaking point with this country now. I have reached the point whereby if Ireland was the only inhabitable place on Earth I would just end my live. The idea of moving overseas to me is a chance at rebirth and a chance to allow myself to be happy, enjoy my life and to be successful.\n\nI just want to get this off my chest, to write it down so I can add some determination and justification in my emigration efforts (I have 2 job interviews for international jobs in the next 2 days).\n\nHere is a list of reasons why Ireland is driving my nuts:\n\n**Friends:**\n\nI have pretty much pushed all of my friends away with my negativity over the last 6 months. You hear those stories about people killing themselves and all their friends saying \"it all makes sense now, when you think about you could see the signs\".  It's been about 3 months now since the last core group of friends abandoned me from there lives (or vice versa I suppose). In that time I have received communication from only one person (other than my housemate and his friends). You see in Ireland in order to maintain healthy friendships you have to be willing to go to the pub. The majority of people here can only have fun when they are drunk and outside of that there has been very little agenda in the \"friendships\" I've made and lost. They wouldn't miss me at all and I'm not keeping anyone happy by staying here. Even my own mother thinks I should GTFO.\n\n**Housing:**\n\nDublin has one of the craziest housing markets in the world. Dublin is the only place in the country that has really recovered from the recession and as such that is where the jobs are and where people need to be. The problem is, Dublin is anti high rise and so all the houses and all the people are spread out over the suburbs (which causes depressingly bad gridlock during commuter times). Also, as a result rent prices are colossal. Prices in the city center are crazy and if you are thinking of moving here to work a modest job and live in the city center be prepared to share a room with at least 3 other people. I live in the suburbs, about 40 minutes commute to the city and still about 35% of my wages went on rent and utilities.\n\n**Economics**\n\nApparent Ireland has the fastest growing economy in Europe, which sounds great on paper. But  we are both burdened and unsustainable. We are hampered with paying back bailouts meaning that any growth in this country do not benefit society as much as it should due the austerity measures that have been placed here over the last 4 years. It feels like moving is a logical way to cheat and escape the burden placed on us. Also the economy is unstable as it is largely reliant on American and European business. \n\nEssentially due to a lack of exporting indigenous businesses, if American corps stop growing or have difficulties in European marketplaces then they will stop hiring and growing Irish operations. Ireland is a horrible place to start a business. Investors are greedy here and state agencies are badly organised and unhelpful. The greatest \"Irish\" business over the last 3 years is Stripe and there is no way in hell they would have done it if they hadn't upped and left to Silicon Valley. Ireland isn't a place that can harbor sustainable indigenous business. \n\nWe also have a modest average income per capita when compared to the rest of North-Western Europe. The average wage is around \u20ac28k but realistically the majority are on way less than that.\n\n**Career Development:**\n\nI don't want to work in some MNC subsidiary anymore - I want to work at the head office of a growing business. I don't know what its like to wake up in the morning and go to work knowing that you are working at the hub of a company and your actions make a difference to that companies development. I'm sick of being called \"another cog in the machine\". As I said before, these companies (at least in my industry) do not exist in Ireland and all the jobs advertised in the industry are in subsidiary offices for MNCs. What's the highest I can hope for in my career? Middle Management? Yippee! (sorry a huge instigator for this rant was a rejection phone call from one of these companies. I gave a bit of a nervy interview so I wasn't expecting to get the job but the way they delivered the rejection was pretty damning and left me a bit speechless - was basically \"fuck you. you are shit\". Well fuck I must be deluded then in thinking I can actually offer something in the jobs market then hey? In my last job (working for an MNC) I felt like I was one of the few people that actually cared about my job and my company but I still seen rather untalented individuals bullshit their way to promotions.\n\n\n**Sex Life**\n\nLook I'm not going to complain about Irish women but I just feel like another face in the crowd. On paper there is nothing unique about me and I reek of depression and negativity so I don't even try. When I do I just feel pretentious as well I am very uninterested in Irish girls. A move abroad changes everything; suddenly I'm both interesting and interested.\n\nSo yes thanks for reading and sorry for the long ranty post but I would really appreciate some encouragement to help enforce my determination to leave. I don't want any drama in the comments just if you think you can relate please leave a comment. Otherwise just ignore.",
