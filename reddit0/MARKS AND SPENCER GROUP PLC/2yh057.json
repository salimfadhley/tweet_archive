We broke up over it.*) \n\n[First update here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21mlis/update_my_boyfriend_m30s_and_i_f20s_broke_up_over/) (**tl;dr**: *After a week of being broken up, my boyfriend realized that living with my dog would be worth getting back together and living together, and proposed a compromise.*)\n___\n\n**And now, almost a year later...**\n\nWell I moved in, and things have been going well. We decided to have separate bedrooms because we both like our alone time, and I wanted to be able to spend time with my dog Callie when I am just hanging out by myself. However, I sleep in my boyfriend's room more often than not.\n\nAnyway, Callie has access to just one room in the house. At first we had baby gates blocking her access to the rest of the house, but now she knows where the boundaries are, and she doesn't cross them. We don't have to use the baby gates anymore.\n\nEventually I built a temporary dog door for our window, and built stairs for her to be able to get to it easily. This has been really awesome because she spends a lot of time outside now. Also I can easily remove it and bring it with me to any house I live that has standard sash windows.\n\nI vacuum about 4 times a week to keep the dog hair down. My boyfriend doesn't even have to use allergy medicine anymore.\n\nYesterday I took Callie out for a hike, and my boyfriend texted me complaining that some door-to-door salesman came by, and that if I hadn't gone hiking with Callie, she would have scared them away. It's true -- she is really awesome at scaring away annoying door-to-door people.\n\nAlso, the three of us went hiking with another couple and their dog. When we took a break to eat, my boyfriend didn't sit down, but instead played with the dogs in the water for a half hour. Our friends didn't believe me when I told them how far my boyfriend has come. \n\nOverall, I'd say this was the biggest issue we ever had to tackle, and we overcame it. Now the three of us live together happily and comfortably. \n\n___\n   \n**tl;dr**: Compromise really does work. ",
