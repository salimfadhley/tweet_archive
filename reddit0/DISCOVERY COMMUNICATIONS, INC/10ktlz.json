All there is in the Discovery Channel building is 2 security guards and some people working late and we already took care of that!\n\n[](/fluttersrs) And why are you wearing a turtleneck? What the...? YOU BOUGHT THAT 900$ TURTLENECK AT RODEO DRIVE?\n\n[](/rdhappy) I got the idea from Archer, *dahlin*. I always dress in style.
