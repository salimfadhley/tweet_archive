Instantly GOOD AFTERNOON SIR! At this point I've only seen a little bit of this Marines dress blues as he's still a little hidden. Slowly I see he's stacked, ribbons galore, and then FUCKING BAM! CHEVRONS! \n\nMy ass is staring straight at SgtMjr of the Marine Corps. Recruit GLU almost fucking didn't fucking sound off to the SgtMjr of the Marine Corps.
