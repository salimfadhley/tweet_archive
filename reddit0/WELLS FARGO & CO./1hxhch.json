  "selftext": "My parents have co-signed a loan my private loan with Wells Fargo (they haven't missed a payment with Wells Fargo or anyone else in 20 years and are in debt 20k) ~10k a year the rest of the debt is federal.  I go to a nice private liberal arts college and am a Political Science major/Theology minor.  I have around 24k a year in scholarships from the school. \n\nEDIT: The school costs 46k so I'm borrowing 22k a year, my parents make around 100k a year and have offered to help pay the debt, but I want to be as independent from them as possible.\n\n\nEdit 2: after asking my parents some questions they told me that they plan to sell off my late grandfathers house and split the money with my 3 uncles and use that to get out of debt once they are out they plan to save as much as possible for helping with my future.  My father told me he thinks my debt problem will be difficult but not impossible I just shouldn't expect to own like a new car or new house.\n\n This is my first post here, I discovered this subreddit looking for a budget planner.  I'm just curious about how worried I should be about being in this much debt, and if there is anything I can do to help ease my burden when I'm out of college?  Thanks for any insight into my personal financial situation :) I apologize if what I'm asking is in the sidebar.\n\n\n\nEDIT:  WOW didn't expect this big of a response thanks!  I know many of you are telling me to go to CC, and I will seriously consider it I have some friends that go to the cheapest MN-scu school in the state and essentially am spending my summer in that city being the lead in a shakespeare play. \n\n Most of you guys also told me to switch majors once again I will consider it, I'm thinking something in econ/analysis would that be a better field?\n\nI spoke to my parents again they told me they will support me in whatever I do and that I shouldn't let the debt scare me as they have almost payed off their mortagage and had plans on selling our house for a large sum, I am not letting this affect my decision and am assuming they will only help me minimally. \n ",
