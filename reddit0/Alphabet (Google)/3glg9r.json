It will act as a holding company for all Google products including it's largest product, Google Search.  \n\nMy question is, why would a company as large as Google, want to keep all their products (companies) in one holding company?  \n\nWouldn't fluctuations in one subsidiary company, affect stock prices of the holding company, and therefore affect the rest of the subsidiaries?\n\n**EDIT: For small business \"serial\" entrepreneurs.  Instead of creating separate entities for each new startup, can one create a holding company that owns all of the little startups?**",
