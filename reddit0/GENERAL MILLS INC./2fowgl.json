All of it. Help is ok but you need to learn it yourself.\n |Accept that it's hard and you won't get it all. Do your best to learn what you can.\n |Get a good study group that does not copy off each other but will help each other through the hard parts.\n |Go to fucking class. All of them if you can. Often lectures will build on the previous one and missing one can really hurt you.\n |Go have fun. Learning to communicate with others and working with others is a necessity you will absolutely need when you're done. Join a band, play some sports, be in a gaming club, whatever. Just make sure you have some social time so you can learn to work with people.\n |Ask for help when you need it. Your profs and lab assistants will help if you are smart enough to ask.\n |Learn to manage your time. Most classes will have weekly assignments, a lab, and a lecture. This can result in having up to a dozen things due every week for grades. If you push shit off to the last minute you will not get it done. Highschool will in no way prepare you for this. It'll come all at once and it's shocking. By 4th year you'll have it down.\n |Don't worry if you fail. It happens. I failed both 1st and 2nd year maths and had to retake all 4 classes but I got through it and didn't quit. Obviously try not to fail but if you do, it's ok. You can retake a class. If you're not failing at something in your life then you're not living. Learn from it, get better, move on.\n |One other thing. Try to get engineering summer jobs or internships. Many companies hire students for technical tasks and this experience will be vital to helping you get a job when you're done. Start looking in October. Seriously, October. By December summer jobs can all be gone.\n |Hope this helps and best of luck!\n[Hello. I'm currently an engineering student. Thank you for doing this AMA. My questions are;  Any tips for a student like me? Like how to learn more/ understand more?   How did you land your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb55vb?context=5)|Ok I'll try to answer these in order: Tips: Study hard but not too hard. Unless you're going into grad studies your grades shouldn't matter much (Here in Canada anyway). Be social and learn some good people skills because you will need them more then math. I haven't done calculus since I graduated. Work in groups if you can but try not to copy. Keep in mind that you are learning the basics of engineering and you may not apply any of it in an actual job. In school you learn to learn and that is the skill you need.  I landed my first job because I knew someone high up in the company and I had a life outside of school. They were impressed that I played music and was involved in things other then studies. It showed I could be a people person who could work with others. This is where the interview process is important. You need to be professional but not a robot. People like to know you're human too. Don't expect much for the first few years. Just get a job and absorb absorb absorb. Opportunities open up pretty quick when you start getting some experience.\n[Is working as an engineering really require all the physical stuff?  How are your working hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb55vb?context=5)|The pay is as good as it should be. Check with your professional association and you will get an idea of pay. Or if you like click here: [Link to www.apegs.ca](http://www.apegs.ca/Portal/Pages/salary-survey)  You can be a desk jockey or you can be a field guy. There are also R&D jobs that are not physical or site related but you should still try to get out there and see what you're building. Seeing the end product of your work and how it's applied is very important experience and will help you make better decisions in your designs.  Working hours can vary quite a bit. I've worked 7days in/7 days out 12 hour days, Monday to friday 8-4, and 4x10hour days per week. There are jobs that require you to be there months as well (offshore drilling, remote mines etc). All in all, I have always enjoyed my shifts and never felt I was being abused.\n[Thank you very much for responding, wow! I'm actually on my 2nd year and it's all just math for now. It's difficult but I get by.  My ideal job would be at the desk. I'm an industrial engineering student actually so I've read that there are many desk-job related work. Do you know anyone who's an industrial engineer? Is their job the same as yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb724p?context=5)|One of my old engineering managers was an industrial engineer who worked for ford. As far as I'm aware (Canadian slant) Industrial engineers deal more with manufacturing and less with the resource industry. It's really tough to nail down exactly what each kind of engineer can do because there is a lot of overlap. Follow your dreams and do what you love and you never know where you'll end up. For example, I no longer do any design but instead organize and run projects. \n[Hey, aspiring mechanical engineer here. What are some tips/advice to becoming a successful engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb4mbm?context=5)|I would suggest that you try a lot of different things and learn what you love. In my career I have worked with operations at a mill keeping things running, as a construction manager running crews building stuff, and as a consultant working with a large team to generate construction drawings for the contractors. Try different things and go with your passion. You may not even end up doing engineering work in the end. For example, I am now a project manager and do no design at all. But my experience with the design and construction side of things really helps make that job a good fit for me. I love field work and I love working with trades.\n |Also, keep your damned mouth shut and ask a lot of questions. A lot of new engineers have the bad habit of thinking they know stuff. The reality is that a trades person with 20 years on the tools will hand you your ass at a lot of design stuff. Learn to respect the trades and ask them for advice when working on designs. Learn to get value out of everyone you work with no matter what their standing is in the company. The IT guy may not have your fancy degree but if you treat them with respect they will save your ass. Same goes for everyone else. Field work is a great way to see it all come together and to get a feel for what you're actually building. However, if hard hats and work boots aren't your thing, office work can be as fun if that's your thing. Really, you have to try a lot and be open to new things every step of the way. I will fully tell you that in my 10 years every single project and in fact every single day has something new to offer. Also, avoid putting in extra time as long as possible. You have the rest of your career to work weekends so don't do it right out of the gate if you don't have to. Once down the path to extra hours it's very hard to back off again.\n\n\n*Last updated: 2014-09-11 02:47 UTC*\n\n*This post was generated by a robot!
