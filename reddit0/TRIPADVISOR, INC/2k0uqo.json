  "selftext": "(my apologies if this isn't the right place for this sort of post)\n\nOver a month ago (September 16) I submitted a copyright complaint through TripAdvisor's process described here: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/copyright_complaint.html\n\nThey are definitely aware of the email and the photo, as I have a log of a visitor viewing the photo in question via the TripAdvisor mail server the very next day (September 17).\n\nThe photo is posted on my Flickr account with a copyright notice and a date that predates the posting of the TripAdvisor photo by several years.  The TripAdvisor photo has a notice at the bottom that indicates it was gathered through their automated tool: \"Management photo from PhotoCrawler: (posted date)\", which as I've read elsewhere, seems to be a shady tool for grabbing whatever photos are posted online, then posting them to TripAdvisor without regard to copyright.  Even in the case of Flickr, where the copyright is in an easy and predictable location.  (Are they inviting a class action lawsuit??)\n\nI expected this to be a nonissue and a quick resolution, but the photo is still up and I haven't received a reply.  What are the next steps to take, short of hiring a lawyer?  Send another courtesy notice?  Start sending them bills?\n\nNov 10 UPDATE: Sent a DMCA takedown, they took down the image about a week later.  No email update like I requested, but they finally did something, so I'm happy.",
