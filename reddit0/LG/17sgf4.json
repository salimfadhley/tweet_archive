  "selftext": "Article pulled from LG's facebook page:\n\nLG Electronic's facebook blowing up by progaming team IM's foreigner fans has become a hot topic.\n\nRecently, LG Electronic's facebook page has been receiving endless \"Thank you for sponsoring IM\" messages from E-Sport's foreigner fans. LG Electronic has been sponsoring IM from April of Last year, and IM, aka LG-IM, has been showing dominating performance in events outside of Korea.\n\nLG Electronic's global brand awareness strategy decisions to sponsor Team IM seems to be a major success. LG-IM, a team consisted of Jae Duk Lim, Jong Hyun Jung, (and among others), is the most popular progaming team that has the biggest foreigner fanbase. Players Jae Duk Lim, Jong Hyun Jung, and Hyunwoo Kang are actively participating in Korean events along with foreigners thus their foreigner fans are expressing hot support.\n\nSome common theme around the foreigner fans' supporting messages are \"Thank you for support LG-IM SC2 team\", \"Thanks to IM I use LG Electronic's products\". Audun Eikli commented, \"Thanks to IM, LG Electronic brand has gained popularity among Norwesians\". Alex Chotvacs commented, \"I use my LG electronic's monitor over 18 hours per day to play Starcraft 2.\n\nAnother fan commented, \"I became aware of LG Electronic through Team IM and I now use numerous LG Electronic's products. Another common theme to note was, \"Please continue to support IM until e-Sports become mainstream\".\n\nWith the release of Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty, e-Sport scene has gained momentum in globalization. The teams that started playing sc2 initially have gained popularity in the foreigner community. It seems apparent that IM has provided signficant advertising effect for LG Electronics. LG-IM team besides from SC2: Wings of Liberty also has a team for League of Legends which has gained its place in e-Sports.\n\nLG-IM's coach, Dong Hoon Kang, responds by stating that he, \"deeply appreciates the foreigner fans' support/love\" to add that he was able to \"reaffirm that we, the e-sports community and the IM gaming team, are effective at promoting at the global level. We will show even more active participation to become more of a \"solid\" team\"",
