They left my ID (thanks I guess), and didn't touch my wedding ring or watch. However, they kept my fucking keys! Modern day key fob with keyless entry and start, so I know it wont be cheap or easy to replace.\n\nI checked account transactions and they had already spent the $530 at gamestop on my credit card and another $230 at a sporting goods store.\n\nI have filed a police report, but I am just really unnerved about the whole situation, I know that the money will get replaced in my account. I just really want my keys back, so I want to help the investigation in any possible way.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would Gamestop keep the serial number on record of a console like an Xbox One or PS4?\n\nEdit: The police immediately went to the GameStop last night to check the surveillance footage. They have assigned a detective to the case. Now I wait for him to call me.",
