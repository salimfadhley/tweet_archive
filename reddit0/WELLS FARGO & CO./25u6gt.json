I will start:\n\n**Top 5 Holdings**\n\n* Gilead Sciences (GILD) - 10%\n* Franklin Income Fund (FKINX) - 8.5%\n* Apple Inc (AAPL) - 6.3%\n* Coca Cola Co. (KO) - 4.4%\n* Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) - 4.2%\n\n**Why?**\n\n* Gilead Sciences (GILD) - See [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/23qvis/mark_my_wordsgilead_will_double_in_2014/) & [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/25e70v/pounding_the_table_on_gild_again/)\n* Franklin Income Fund (FKINX) - See [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/205urf/to_counter_all_the_praise_of_index_funds_what_are/cg0ipj4). Original purpose as the bond allocation with upside, the fund has kind of moved away from that though.\n* Apple Inc (AAPL) - Believe the firm has great upside potential from here and in the future.\n* Coca Cola Co. (KO) - Another Bedrock to keep returns less volatile.\n* Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) - Best run bank in the US\n\n**Things Needing to Add**\n\n* Some sort of oil position - Majors are declining in production, and small cap oil companies in shale areas are too volatile.  \n* Smaller Cap investments - New money is being set aside for either Mid Cap or Small Cap stocks as most money is in Large Caps currently.\n\nSo what about you?  What are your top holdings and why?  \n\n**EDIT** Feel free to list whatever asset classes are your top holdings; Funds/ETFs/Stocks/Bonds/Commodities/Hedge Funds/Real Estate.... whatever. Just discuss why it is your top holdings.",
