After I got a BFA in sculpture and really sick of how artists talk to and treat each other- and not being able to find work- I went to community for an associates in automated technology. The program has been heavy in CAD, CAD, and CNC technology, but in my current and final semester, I've had a class in PLCs (SLC500) and I really enjoy it.\n\nI saw a post at school for have a controls trainee position. Sent a resume, had a phone interview, now I have an in-person interview with the HR and controls dept heads. Anyone have ANY advice for me to impress them?\n\nI don't have a ton of experience in the field- I've been working for the past few months at a machine shop and I build electronics from schematics I find online for fun. I know what AC and 3 phase are but don't know a whole lot about the particulars. Is there any free online reading I can brush up on to help me a little bit in the interview?\n\nBasically, if any industry pros are reading this, I'd really like advice. My meeting is Wednesday. Thanks!",
