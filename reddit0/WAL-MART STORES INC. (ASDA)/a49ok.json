The greeter also tried to physically restrain me which I would imagine isn't allowed in their policy and could be considered assault. Thanks Walmart for treating everyone like thieves, and also thanks to the people who frequent it.\n\n**Update**: went to the doctor and got a tetanus shot and some anti-inflammatory meds. Went to the store and wasn't all that surprised to only find an assistant manager who had no idea what their policy on detainment was.\n\n**Update 2**: Also, to everyone saying \"why didn't you just show him the receipt?\": I paid with cash, and I was given the receipt back along with the change - all of which I put in my wallet with other bills/change/receipts, so finding it was no easy task even when I needed it to prove my innocence. I even asked \"is the receipt in the bag?\" when I was done checking out, because I hadn't remembered that she gave it to me with the change. So, yes, majorly inconvenienced for a small inconvenience *which still is not required by law and they had no real probable cause*.",
