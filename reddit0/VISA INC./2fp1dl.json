I turn and find an elderly woman needs assistance. I give her a \"how do you do?\" to which she responds,\n>\"Boy come help me fax this!\".\n\n\"A simple fax: Load Paper, Punch Numbers in, Send. how hard can it be?\" Off I go behind the elderly woman as she limps out of my department and into the mystical land of the copy center where we have a DIY fax machine. \n\n>\"Watch this boy!\",\n\nshe snaps, as she loads in the paper, hits 'fax' on the machine and puts a number in and hits send. all of her hard word is greeted with a hefty buzz as the machine fails to follow her command. \"It's busted!\" she says, to which I look on the screen which reads 'Please insert card into Pinpad'. \n>\"Ma'am\" i say, \"the machine isn't broken, you just need to swipe your credit or debit card into the card reader\".\n\nOut comes a purse which must have been bigger on the inside because things bigger than my hand begin to come out. An action figure, a wooden cross, a cell phone, a wifi hotspot, a wad of pens and papers and finally a wallet! \n\n>\"How much for this fax boy?\"\n\n the woman asks, to which i promptly reply, \n\n>\"Ma'am it's about 3$ for you to fax X amount of sheets\". \n\nOut comes three one dollars bills, to which confuse me. she begins to hand them to me saying \n\n>\"insert them boy! I want this sent so I can leave already!\"\n\n>\"Ma'am, this is a Credit card machine. It accepts only Credit or Debit cards\".\n\n>\"BOY! I was there when this was invented! Mr.GuyWhoseNameIDontKnow INVENTED THESE IN ->Year- TO ACCEPT CASH SO THAT CASHIERS WOULDN'T BE NEEDED ANY MORE, CREDIT CARDS WERE INVENTED >BY ACCIDENT FROM THIS MACHINE! I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAN YOU!\"\n\nA customer who knows more about technology than I do, but still comes to me to fix problems they're having with technology? sounds like a regular day to me right? wrong. Throw some more faux history and berating and this woman decides to show me as she struggles to stuff cash into the card reader in the PinPad machine. \n\n>\"It's not working boy, fix it for me! Stop standing there like an idiot and fix your cash reader machine! If you >can't fix it then you're an idiot!\" \n\nI simply look at her, then look at my department which has exactly one person looking at a printer and radio in, \n>\"Hey Manager, my department is full of people, can you get CopyCenterEmployee to come help someone with a fax?\"\n\nNeedless to say, this elderly woman gave me a look which might have suggested I had just stabbed her and walked away.\n\nI Checked in later with CopyCenterEmployee and it turns out the woman did have a debit card, but was afraid to use it because we might steal her identity, so she called in her husband who used his card to pay for her fax. \n\nTl;Dr: Credit Card machines only accept debit or credit cards because they're accidents.
