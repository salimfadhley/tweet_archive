  "selftext": "I have been seeing quite a lot of posts of people getting ripped off by fraudsters by posing to be bank officials and getting debit/credit card information.\n\nI cannot stress enough on the fact that you should never give out your Card information especially the CVV number and PIN number to any one over mail or on a call. Also when doing an online transaction - make sure it is a secure website (starting with https://) and that you enable visa 3D secure or similar security features.\n\nBut in cases where you receive such calls/mails, please report it to the bank authorities. I know people dont want to be bothered about complaining to the Police, as the chance of any action is absolutely zero. But unlike the Police, the Banks and especially organizations like RBI/VISA/Mastercard etc are very very serious about this kind of issues, as they loose millions of Rs/$ every year over card fraud.\n\nFollowing are some of the places you can report the stuff to:\n\n* VISA - phishing@visa.com / 000 117 866 765 9644\n* Mastercard - stopit@mastercard.com / 1800-102-6263\n* HDFC - fake.email@hdfcbank.com\n* ICICI - antiphishing@icicibank.com\n* SBI - report.phishing@sbi.co.in\n* Canara - reportphishing@canbank.co.in\n* BoB - barodaconnect@bankofbaroda.com\n* PNB - cybercrime@pnb.co.in\n\nAlso check if there is a cyber crimes cell of the police force in your city. They will be more receptive of such complaints.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention - you will also find helpline/tollfree numbers for your bank behind your Credit/Debit card.\n\nAdditional Info: While I certainly endorse the view of may of you - about using stricter security measures, encrypted apps, lower limits etc. - all this additional security is no cure for your stupidity. Stupidity is a harsh term, but most of us never really care about this kind of information till we have our own bad experience. Your banking information is a private information that you need to keep to yourselves (Information like the CVV, PIN, IPIN, OTP - even the bank employees do not have preview of). The more the number of people who know about your banking information - the higher your risk.\n\nAny failure in the bank's security system - you can get back your money. But if you give up information voluntary - then the bank cannot take responsibility for your loss - and you will end up loosing your \"Hard Earned Money\".\n\nEdit: htpps-->https & CCV-->CVV",
