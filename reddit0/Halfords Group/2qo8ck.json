But little did the colony of Halford know, something, some evil entity whose sole purpose was to cause havoc had spied their little corner of the universe, and it intended to bring a little chaos with it...</p>\n\n<p>Dmitri carried his R4 slung over his bad shoulder. Doc said he could get a bionic arm for it, that it&#39;d be even better than before, but he was scared of bionics. He&#39;d always said it just wasn&#39;t natural. Besides, his arm still worked, even without his hand. </p>\n\n<p>The walk across the dry plains was always a long one, but he&#39;d finally spied his mark. There, amongst the tall grass was a herd of Muffalo, grazing. Just at the edge of the herd was a large male bull, drinking from the watering hole they&#39;d been frequenting. Dmitri brought up his rifle, resting the barrel over his stump, just above his wrist. He took a bead on the bull, ever carefully lining up the shot. With a high pitched, sci-fi whirr from the R4, the big Muffalo dropped right on the spot. One good burst was all it took from Dmitri, ever the marksman. </p>\n\n<p>He&#39;d just slung the big animal over his bad shoulder when he heard something odd from the bushes around the watering hole. He tried to look back, but he couldn&#39;t manage it, what with the bull he&#39;d just slung over his shoulder. He sure as anything wasn&#39;t putting it back down, it was pain enough to pick it up. He brushed it off and started the trek back to camp. After all, even without a heatwave, it was well over 30C and he could go for a nice stay in the freezer room while he cut this thing up.</p>\n\n<p>He&#39;d barely made it ten paces when he heard the sound again. It was closer this time. What was it? It almost sounded like...chittering. Again, he simply brushed it off as nothing and continued on. He started a more brisk pace. The sound was even closer. He could identify it now, it was a squirrel, or rather a few squirrels. It sounded like they were worked up over something, probably having a fight. He didn&#39;t have time to look back, he could really go for a meal and the last thing he wanted to do was watch a squirrel fight. The bickering of the little animals didn&#39;t go away as he got closer to home, rather it got louder. There must&#39;ve be a whole bunch of the things with how many he was hearing. He finally decided to set the big Muffalo down and check out what was going on. What he saw horrified him.</p>\n\n<p>In the distance, maybe twenty meters out, were the tribespeople from upriver. They had their weapons brandished against a horde of squirrels. There must&#39;ve been at least thirty or forty of the little hairy rodents. The tribespeople had been visiting the colony for about a day, he&#39;d even chewed the fat with one of them, Redfields, about the ins and outs of hunting that morning. But something was very wrong. The group of them were panicked, and the onslaught of fur unleashed itself against them. It was over in mere seconds.  Dmitri turned tail and ran for the base. He radioed back frantically, telling his comrades of his odd predicament.  He peered back over his shoulder, the rodents were gaining on him. Ahead, he could see home, and with it were his fellow colonists. Something was wrong. They were already outside and shooting, but at what?</p>\n\n<p>Then it dawned on him. The squirrels. Some had already made it there. But they couldn&#39;t have came from the group chasing him, could they? Had all the area&#39;s squirrels gone mental? He didn&#39;t have time to answer that. One of the furry bastards latched onto heel. How had they closed the gap so fast? He kicked it off and turned around, rifle at the ready. What he saw was pure hell. The thirty or so chasing him had split up surrounding him on three sides, and his armor vest wasn&#39;t going to stop what was about to happen. He fired into the horde frantically, and he knew he&#39;d taken out a few by the smell of singed fur, but it wasn&#39;t enough. There were too many. The mass of rodents converged upon him and let loose their fury. He could feel the little demons digging their teeth through his tortoise leather pants and into his calves. The pain lit right up his leg as another and yet another latched on further and further up his legs. He fruitlessly fired another burst of plasma fire toward his feet but to no avail. Stumbling backward, Dmitri caught his foot on a rock and fell hard onto his back. The small furried horde began biting him on all sides, causing him unbearable pain. It was all over, he thought. He was going to go out like this, being eaten alive by a bunch of squirrels, hundreds of billions of miles away from home on some god forsaken world.</p>\n\n<p>He was just blacking out when he heard his comrade, Raygun calling out to him. He could just hear her voice above the squeaking masses. Just as his vision faded, he heard the unleashing of hell. Raygun had spun up her minigun and opened it up on the horde.</p>\n\n<p>Dmitri was surprised when he awoke. It wasn&#39;t that he was in the infirmary, it was that he was even alive. To his right were a couple of his fellow colonists, also in bed. Raygun was in the bed nearest to him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I saved your life you know.&quot; she said, her voice a bit dry.</p>\n\n<p>Dmitri looked over at her. She had a few bandages on her arms and legs, but she&#39;d be alright. Just as he&#39;d went to speak, Doc walked in, carrying a tray with a nice meal and some water. He handed it to Raygun and then turned his attention to Dmitri.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re real lucky to have pulled through. This place might be a bit makeshift, but I still gave you the best care this side of the Delta Systems, and even with that you almost died. First it was all the bites, but then an infection tore through you so fast we couldn&#39;t amputate fast enough. Lucky for you we had spare parts.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s when it hit him, harder than a dreadnaught&#39;s fusion reactor going critical.
