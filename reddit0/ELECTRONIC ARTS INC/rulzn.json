  "selftext": "Press release [here](http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=662095).\n\n>REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BioWare, a Label of Electronic Arts Inc. announced Mass Effect\u2122 3: Extended Cut, a downloadable content pack that will expand upon the events at the end of the critically acclaimed Action RPG. Through additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes, the Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut will give fans seeking further clarity to the ending of Mass Effect 3 deeper insights into how their personal journey concludes. Coming this summer, the Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut will be available for download on the Xbox 360\u00ae videogame and entertainment system, PlayStation\u00ae3 computer entertainment system and PC for no extra charge*.\n\n>\"We are all incredibly proud of Mass Effect 3 and the work done by Casey Hudson and team,\" said Dr. Ray Muzyka, Co-Founder of BioWare and General Manager of EA's BioWare Label. \"Since launch, we have had time to listen to the feedback from our most passionate fans and we are responding. With the Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut we think we have struck a good balance in delivering the answers players are looking for while maintaining the team's artistic vision for the end of this story arc in the Mass Effect universe.\"\n\n>Casey Hudson, Executive Producer of the Mass Effect series added, \"We have reprioritized our post-launch development efforts to provide the fans who want more closure with even more context and clarity to the ending of the game, in a way that will feel more personalized for each player.\"\n\nSo, it looks like for now, the \"ending\" DLC won't pick up from the Destroy \"alive\" ending, and will instead just give us some more epilogues / cutscenes of what happens after the space magic?\n\nIf so, then what was up with the breath? I'm really firmly in the IT camp, but I feel like this announcement is a bit disappointing. I really was hoping for some insanely awesome announcements on Friday, but now I'm not sure.\n\nWhat are [/r/indoctrinated](/r/indoctrinated)'s thoughts on this one?\n\n**UPDATE**:\nFrom the Bioware blog on the subject:\n\n>Are there going to be more/different endings or ending DLCs in the future?\nNo. BioWare strongly believes in the team\u2019s artistic vision for the end of this arc of the Mass Effect franchise. The extended cut DLC will expand on the existing endings, but no further ending DLC is planned.\n\nDoesn't really say anything new, but seems to imply there won't be any DLC after this one, set after then current end of the game. Meaning that the \"breath\" scene may very well have been either:\n\n* A gigantic fanwank cock-tease (Lot's of speculation for everyone!!)\n* A hint at a future game\n* Leaving themselves a backdoor in case they decide they still love our money\n\n\n**UPDATE 2 (Electric Boogaloo)**\n\nIt looks like the possibility of hearing more from Commander Shepard in the DLC isn't entirely ruled out. Someone asked Mike Gamble about the fact that Meer and Hale hadn't heard anything / been asked back yet, and responded with \"don't worry. All that is in the works\"  [Source](https://twitter.com/#!/GambleMike/status/187929762017193984)\n\nNot exactly concrete, but still gives me hope. More VO work for Shep means the reports of her death may have been greatly exaggerated.\n\n**UPDATE 3 (Revenge of the Merizan)**\n\nLooks like the PAX panel might just be a massive circle-jerk over how great Bioware / ME3 is... According to this tweet from Jessica Merizan, they will not be discussing the ending DLC at all. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4Xxks.png\n\nThe real question is, then... IS there some massive surprise reveal tomorrow, as we'd been lead to believe, or were we just letting ourselves get our hopes up over a supposed conversation at a foreign convention?\n\nAnd IF there is, what could it be? New game? Multiplayer DLC? Something else?",
