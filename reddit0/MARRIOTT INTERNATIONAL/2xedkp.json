  "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI just started getting into churning and will be getting married in a few months.  I had originally planned to get a Marriott card since we have a lot of out of town guests and our hotel block is at Marriott. Given I'm about to spend a decent amount at marriott, would the best thing to do be: get the Marriott 70k offer n put it all on there? (Possibly pay for a few rooms with that 70k?). Or is there a card that I could get that will provide better benefits going forward?  I travel a lot, rarely stay at Marriott chain in the past.  I currently have united and sw card x2; but do not have any hotel cards.  I will be going to Mexico for my honeymoon, so a no international fee card would be nice, I was thinking CSP?\n\nMy main goal is to be able to put the spend on a card that gives me high return value, regardless of what form it's in (points/cb).
