  "selftext": "> Recent news from Discovery Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:DISCA) has disclosed the company's interest in developing a streaming service. Discovery is not attempting to offer a direct service to all Internet users, but is rather targeting existing satellite and cable subscribers and looking to charge them $6-8 per month to access produced content 3-18 months old. In essence, Discovery is looking to broaden its revenue distribution base to include cable, satellite, traditional streaming (Netflix and Amazon), and now an additional streaming offering. **Also of note, Discovery claims that this is in early development stages and roughly 2-5 years down the road.**\n\nQuote from - http://seekingalpha.com/article/1540812-why-netflixs-biggest-threat-may-be-discovery-communications\n\nPastebin of the website - http://pastebin.com/Jav26BU0\n\nScreenshot on Netflix - http://i.imgur.com/M18L0QH.jpg\n",
