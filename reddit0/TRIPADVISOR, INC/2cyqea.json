It never fails to amuse/irritate me how stupid people are.  \n\n\"Oh, and there was no parking!\"  Cause there is a convention in town and everyone is here for it.   \n\n\"The desk-staff was terrible!\" That's because you tried to coerce our receptionist into our bar while your wife was upstairs in bed.\n\n\"I didn't get the room I booked!\"  Dude, you **requested** a room with a balcony that I told you we didn't have available when you made the reservation.  You booked a standard.  I agreed I'd move you to a balcony *if it became available*.  Next time, I'll pull out a fucking dictionary and let you read what the word \"request\" means.\n\nWhat's worse is I generally care about these people's experiences with out hotel.  I want them to have a good time and enjoy our their stay. \n\n That's the point; you enjoy your holiday, I get to help make it special, you go home and tell your friends, they bring in more revenue, and eventually I hope to get a raise.  I care about my job and I want them to enjoy their holiday, but they are too busy being fucking stupid and discount hunting.\n\n\n\nIn short, people suck, I'm addicted to the hospitality industry, and my life makes no sense.  Where's my beer?",
