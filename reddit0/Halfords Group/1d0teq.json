  "selftext": "Firstly, my heart goes out to Puck, Scarlett, Tilea, and everyone else in the male-dominated Starcraft community who has been going through their own transgender comprehension.  As a strong ally to the community since High School (I am now 28), I sympathize the most I can as a straight male.  Your willingness to be open to the community at large is incredible, and I hope others are courageous enough to take your lead.\n\nCommunally, what is fantastic about this issue is community members being able to see, many for the first time, these very common struggles for any in the LGBTQ community and learn along with the people going through them themselves.  There are tons of comments/post that are ignorant, but many are not maliciously so.  They are made by young people trying to learn and sympathize in a way they have no yet had to experience.  And that is fantastic.\n\nThe Starcraft community is split because it is populated with mostly very smart people, but many of whom are also very young and are learning to navigate the waters of their own intelligence.\n\nPuck's response to the [reddit post today] (http://ff.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1d0bjn/is_leiya_puckk_again/) show incredible courage and wherewithal on Puck's part, and also many people trying hard to understand something completely foreign with them.  Though there are bad bumps in the road\u2014and many negative-karma comments\u2014I can't help but be excited for the general discourse that is going on within the community.\n\nIt's very easy to sweep these sort of things under the rug; and society and most sub-cultures have been doing that for years.  But it's events like these (and people like this) that bring up these difficult issues that make changes in the community and society as a whole.  \n\nI know many of you are likely too young, I am as well, but when Rob Halford of Judas Priest, a metal icon/demi-god, came out as gay, it created a whole new stratification within the predominately homophobic metal community between those accepting of it and those who were initially skeptical.  The community as a whole was ignorant about the issue, but since that point, the community has developed more nuanced opinions on the issue.  And though many within the community still disagree, the level of discourse was forever raised.  And now, even the most [Heavy Metal Parking Lot kids] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhRCVm-1r2k) of the bunch have at least developed some position on the issue (for better and for worse).\n\nFor every ignorant hater, there are ignorant questers.  People who use events and people like this to extend their own knowledge and break down their biases.  If becoming an adult is defined as perpetually reexamining and breaking down your own biases, people like Puck, et al. help us all grow in amazing ways.\n\nI know this is a slathering, love-everyone post, but I know this community often gets mired in drama and bullshit, but we are a strong, smart group of people who are able to constantly surprise me.  And I wondered if other people feel the same way.\n\nTL DR; Transgender issues within the community are clearly helping us to grow as a unit.  And we should commend and encourage transgendered people (and others) to talk about these issues because  as a smart community, we can handle these small differences to raise the level of discourse on the whole.
