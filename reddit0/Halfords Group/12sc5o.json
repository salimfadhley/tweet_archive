  "selftext": "Hey guys, love this sub, its great for finding new bands and checking up on news from around the world, and it seems like a somewhat nice sub, so i decided to be bold and raise a question that for me, has been needing to get asked for a while...\n\nAre there any other gay metal heads out there? It might sound ridiculous, but you don't often hear about them. I know Gaahl is gay, as well as Rob Halford, but i don't often hear about gay men that play Death Metal or go to shows. I know for me, I make up the majority of the gay population as well as the metal community in my town, and out of my social groups in other cities, im the only gay metal head that i know of... People have seemed fairly accepting, or at least those who know as its not really a piece of conversation when at a show, the band usually is the main topic there, although, is it like this in other cities, and countries? (Im Canadian by the way) As well, what are your opinions on the LGBT community? Are you fond of or not fond of the community? Just like to know peoples thoughts on the subject, any past experiences at shows, etc etc. \n\nAlso, if you like Technical music or Progressive Death Metal, go check out Beyond Creation, they are a Canadian band from Montreal, incredible playing and composition that is just starting to get somewhere and deserve many more fans. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. There is also Blotted Science, an incredibly technical band that works with 12 tone systems featuring Alex Webster from cannibal corpse on bass, Ron Jarzombeck from gordian knot and spastic ink on guitar, and Hannes Grossman from Obscura and Necrophagist on drums. \n\nThanks for reading, have a brutal day and continue smashing faces with hammers. \\m/",
