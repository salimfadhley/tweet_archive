Please let me know if you have everything.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW HARD WAS THAT TO HAVE SOME BEARING OF COMPREHENSIVENESS WHEN POSING A QUESTION?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more accurate your message is the easier it is to respond towards, and the easy messages GET REPLIES FIRST. The stuff we have to look up in emails and order books - GET REPLIED LAST. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t expect prompt responses right now either. Everyone is still slammed. My bank account is growing at an alarming rate.</p>\n\n<p>Licenses for transfer - OH FUCKING GOD DONT GET ME STARTED ON LICENSES</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a pre-transfer checklist you should go through that will save you a bunch of grief.</p>\n\n<p>One - <del>Cut a hole a box</del> Ask your dealer HOW THEY WANT TO DO TRANSFERS IF THEY ARE DOING THEM. Each house does things differently.</p>\n\n<p>Editors note: Fundamentally - here&#39;s how it works. You buy from dealer out of area. Your local retailer sends a license to the dealer out of area, they ship the gun and when it is ready to go they&#39;ll call you and say HEY YOUR GUN IS HERE GET IT OUT OF HERE BEFORE WE ACCIDENTALLY SELL IT.</p>\n\n<p>If you buy from an INDIVIDUAL they do not need an FFL to ship it. Jam the gun in a box with a note of who it&#39;s from and who it&#39;s for and send the goddamn thing. Don&#39;t ask for a license copy because it&#39;s not needed and we won&#39;t send one.</p>\n\n<p>Two - GETTING A LICENSE TO THE OTHER FFL - HOLY FUCKING SHITBALLS THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS GODDAMN COMPLICATED BUT IT IS BECAUSE ALL GUN DEALERS ARE PEDANTIC BUREAUCRATIC FETISHISTS THIS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AREA OF ANY TRANSFER SECOND TO THE PERSON SCREWING UP THE 4473</p>\n\n<p>Many dealers, are STUCK IN THE 1980&#39;S AND WILL ONLY FAX STUFF. I suggest you avoid these dealers like the plague. If they won&#39;t get with the late 1990&#39;s, much less the 2013&#39;s - you can be pretty certain there&#39;s going to be FUD and Fudd&#39;s. Optimally have them email it. Ask if they&#39;re set up for that as it makes things quick and easy. If they emaill or (ugh) fax it - there&#39;s still a few other issues I&#39;ve listed below.</p>\n\n<p>LEGIBLE LICENSES ARE IMPORTANT. Here&#39;s why: When I get a CAMERAPHONE PICTURE OF A LICENSE that is so out of focus that a VHS tape of a 7-11 robbery on three second delay has more resolution - goes straight to the trash. I can&#39;t use it. ATF has to have a legible license and I HAVE TO READ THE THING TO GET THE SHIPPING ADDRESS ANYWAYS. When I get blurry crap your order goes to the bottom of my priority list. Don&#39;t be that guy. Also don&#39;t be the guy sending me a 9 megabyte .bmp of a license either. Yes, that really happened. Keep this shit legible and keep this shit simple.</p>\n\n<p>CARRIER AND SHIPPING ADDRESS IS IMPORTANT. Here&#39;s why: Licenses have TWO SECTIONS. One says PREMISES ADDRESS and the other says MAILING ADDRESS. Most dealers - it&#39;s the exact same thing. Some dealers have a separate PO box or alternate address where they get mail and other deliveries. UPS and Fedex cannot deliver to a PO Box. This is why it&#39;s important to find out ahead of time what carrier will be used and which address needs to be used. I&#39;ve had too many cases where I sent to mailing and they get mad because I should have sent to premises and vice versa. SORT THAT SHIT OUT SO I DONT HAVE TO. Ultimately, you&#39;re the one on the hook if there&#39;s a problem because I&#39;ve already been paid and sent the merch.</p>\n\n<p>IF YOU SHOW ME YOURS I&#39;LL SHOW YOU MINE - THIS. IS. INFURIATING. There are dealers that will not send their license to another dealer unless they get theirs first. I&#39;ll let that sink in for a moment as I realize that this is the adult version of showing boob/vagina/penis in kindergarten to each other. It is stupid, it is a waste of time. The people that do this will say &quot;WELL WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE OTHER PERSON GETTING OUR LICENSE IS A DEALER SO WE HAVE TO VERIFY THAT&quot; - BULL. FUCKING. SHIT. They&#39;re being pedantic. Send license to other retailer. They send gun with invoice. Simple as that. Avoid any retailer that engages in this idiotic round robin. Some dealers will also demand a first three last five for EZcheck so they can do a miniaturization of if you show me yours I&#39;ll show you mine which is pointless for two reasons. One, as of this writing EZcheck does not work. Two, the ATF publishes a list of FFL&#39;s that is in the public domain. If they want to check the validity of a dealer they can simply go to the database and do a hard pull. Just tell them to send the damn license.</p>\n\n<p>I HAVE TO HAVE YOUR LICENSE OR PHOTO ID WITH THE GUN OTHERWISE THIS WILL NOT GET RELEASED - I have had license forgery issues in the past and ATF said not to send out licenses anymore. I asked them if it was legal. They said it was, and I hadn&#39;t thought about it. When dealers get stuff in from wholesalers - wholesalers do not enclose their FFL. They just ship the gun with an invoice. By golly, ATF was right. I looked in the reg book. I need a license to send a gun to another dealer. The other dealer does not need my license. Some dealers have a paperwork fetish and DEMAND AN FFL OR THE PHOTO ID OF THE PERSON THAT SENT IT. I&#39;d avoid retailers like this. I had one retailer HOLD THE GUN HOSTAGE BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING A SHITHEAD. For a bunch of people shouting we have enough gun laws, they have no problem making more of them under the banner of &quot;store policy&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>EXPIRED/UNSIGNED LICENSES - Jesus tapdancing christ, I&#39;ve had about TEN expired or unsigned licenses in the past week alone. It has been unreal. If the license is expired, it should come with an extension letter. If there is no extension letter it is useless and will go in the trash and your gun won&#39;t ship. If the license has no signature, it will also go in the trash as it is useless. Make sure your dealer is on the ball with this. I had one dealer email me after I had emailed him my license so he could send a gun out and he was ALARMED and freaking out. I asked him what the problem was at which point he asked me if the license I sent over was correct - AS IT WAS SIGNED AND DATED 12 MONTHS PRIOR as if I had just admitted I like watching furry snuff films while listening to Justin Bieber. The dude was low volume and signed and dated each one as they demanded. I&#39;m too old for that shit. </p>\n\n<p>Three - Time in Transit and picking up your shit. UPS and Fedex take a while, especially if you&#39;re not paying for overnight service. Don&#39;t shoot the messenger. Don&#39;t call every day. Wait your turn and quit bothering us since we got shit to do for other people. Do expect to be called when it is in and be ready to head over there and pick it up. I hate people who order stuff KNOWING THEY ARE GOING OUT OF TOWN FOR A WEEK AND HALF and I have to be your warehouse boy. I don&#39;t want to charge for storage but I am tempted to sometimes. </p>\n\n<p>PICKING UP YOUR SHIT - BRING VALID PHOTO ID AND FILL OUT THE GODDAMN FORM PROPERLY. I&#39;m sick and tired of hearing &quot;I JUST MOVED WHATS THE PROBLEM HERE&quot; - if you hand me a 4473 and it says 123 Main St and your ID says 1060 West Addison, and I ask which one is current and you say 1060 West Addison, I am going to rip up the 4473 right in front of you and tell you to get a new ID. GET THAT SHIT DONE BEFORE YOU COME IN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. I had one guy have his roommate take a cameraphone photo of his ID that he left at home that DEMANDED THAT I ACCEPT A CAMERAPHONE PICTURE OF HIS LICENSE. ATF requires me to have a valid photo ID present, not a photo of one. </p>\n\n<p>Editors note: I AM NOT ADVOCATING LYING OR BREAKING THE LAW IN ANY WAY but this is one of those moments where gun control laws fail. If someone were to lie on ATF Form 4473 about their address, such as using an old address on an ID that was not current - it would likely not be caught by ATF or the dealer because there is no way to actively validate addresses. If you claim to live at an address and your ID supports it, absent a spontaneous utterance of HEY I JUST MOVED - the dealer takes it as face value and proceeds with sale. Frequently dealers will ask &quot;Still on (insert your current address here)?&quot; as they are going through your forms and if you say yes, that&#39;s the end of it. If you say no, the sale stops. Would you get in trouble for lying on the form? It&#39;s possible but not probable as ATF would have to prove you were not living there. This is one of the flaws in gun control legislation as the law is on the books but there is no practical enforcement action. </p>\n\n<p>PAYING FOR YOUR TRANSFER - Please bring cash. We love cash. We also love food. If you bring food we will love you.</p>\n\n<p>All that was easy right, totally worth the $8 the dealer makes after putting up with all your bullshit. Now get out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
