He will then be moved to intensive care for monitoring.\n\n~~I have users reporting that Sky has reported he is now out of surgery and in intensive care.

James Slater (Skysports) is also reporting that he has not undergone a second surgery and remains in intensive care.\n\n**Update:**\n\nLots of sources - though none that I know to be reliable - are reporting that Bianchi's parents have now arrived at the hospital. Thus an update on his condition may be coming soon.\n\n**Update:**\n\nSky Sports F1 [is reporting](https://twitter.com/SkySportsF1/status/519114898744569856) that an FIA media chief has reported Jules' is now in a critical but stable condition. I have not found the primary source for this, but it is believed to be reliable.\n\n**Update:**\n\nJules' remains in a critical but stable condition after a single three hour surgery after the accident. Professor G\u00e9rard Saillant who oversaw the initial treatment of Michael Schumacher after his skiing accident late last year is consulting with the family. There are reports that an update is imminent. \n\n**Update:**\n\nMarussia has just released a statement - Bianchi has a [Diffuse Axonal Injury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_axonal_injury). [Here](https://i.imgur.com/ji9Txec.jpg) is a screenshot of the full statement.\n\n**Update:**\n\nIn light of Jules' accident, [Marussia will only be running one car](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/) at Sochi. The FIA is [reported](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/2iuw0c/fia_plans_to_take_decision_on_how_much_to_slow/) to take the decision away from drivers about how much to slow under yellow flags however they [have also been reported as saying](https://twitter.com/JennieGow/status/520580491045797888) that Jules did slow down under the yellow flags being waved at the time of his accident.\n\nI don't expect to be updating this any further until another statement is made regarding Bianchi's condition.

It was raining heavily at the start and ends of the race. At the end of the race a German driver, Adrian Sutil crashed into a tyre barrier. When the marshals were retrieving his car another driver - Jules Bianchi - also crashed. Mika Salo, a sort of \"referee\" for this race has seen the footage of Bianchi's crash and has told us that Bianchi collided with the tractor that was retrieving Sutil's car. This footage has not been yet made available to the public though a video from the grandstand has surfaced. Bianchi was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery. His condition is very serious and all of our thoughts are with him and those close to him.",

It was raining heavily at the start and ends of the race. At the end of the race a German driver, Adrian Sutil crashed into a tyre barrier. When the marshals were retrieving his car another driver - Jules Bianchi - also crashed. Mika Salo, a sort of &quot;referee&quot; for this race has seen the footage of Bianchi&#39;s crash and has told us that Bianchi collided with the tractor that was retrieving Sutil&#39;s car. This footage has not been yet made available to the public though a video from the grandstand has surfaced. Bianchi was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery. His condition is very serious and all of our thoughts are with him and those close to him.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
