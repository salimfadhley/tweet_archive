I asked my friends who have recently passed how much they got on their insurance. One of my friends got 1100 on a 9month deal (Direct Line) on their 2009 VW Golf. And another one of my friends also on direct line got 1300 on their Ford Fiesta (X reg). When I come to get my quote they range from 1900-3000!! I&#39;ve added near enough the same details. Mother main driver, fully comp all that. So I want to know is what is it that&#39;s allows them to get cheaper car insurance? Or is there something I&#39;m doing wrong? Perhaps suggest another insurance company (I&#39;ve looked at most). But any advice would be most appreciated.
