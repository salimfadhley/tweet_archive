And you will probably ask : how did you manage to do it at the 101 attempt?\n\nMy answer is  - I don't know, i just did it. You all have seen Nike Inc. slogan - \"Just Do It\", it's something like this. One day you wake up at the bottom of a well and you feel deep inside that this time you're gonna do it no matter how, you are gonna climb that well. The first two weeks are harder, but after that you should always repeat to yourself - \"i've come too far to come back now\" and you will made it. You will climb the well and you will see a different world outside of it. Believe me!",
