I've been searching far and wide for domain names and I came across one (and subsequently bought) that includes the word \"bay\" at the end of it. \n\nA few days after my purchase, I vaguely remembered something from a business law class I took years ago. Something about a trademark dilution lawsuit. I did some digging and came across [Perfumebay.com, Inc. v. eBay Inc](http://www.cooley.com/files/tbl_s5SiteRepository/FileUpload21/1256/Press%20Release%20-%20eBay%20vs%20PerfumeBay%20Decision%20Nov%2007.pdf).\n\nThis is a case from 2007 and my question is: does eBay still aggressively try to stomp out any other company with the word \"bay\" in it? AND would the courts still rule in the favor of eBay?\n\nI'm trying to avoid legal troubles, but I'm in love with the domain name.\n\nIn no way am I attempting to dilute eBay's trademark, and I was even considering putting a disclamer somewhere on the website stating \"This company is not affiliated with eBay.com.\" \n\nWhat does /r/legaladvice think? \n\n**Edit:** I have the resources to get another domain, and I have. I guess I'm more concerned (philosophically) about what I perceive to be the perverse use of trademark in this country today. I feel that there are instances (like perfume bay) where eBay went REALLY overboard where any reasonable person wouldn't confuse the two brands. Ideas?",
