Discography  \n\n##Sound Evolution  \n\n(wall of text inc., sorry)  \n\nOriginally, BTS came out as a full-fledged hip-hop group with a \u201cbad boy\u201d image. Their school trilogy focused on the problems teens in school face, with No More Dream asking teens to think about what their dream for the future is, rather than going through life mindlessly following what their parents tell them to do. The follow-up single, We Are Bulletproof pt. 2, declared their confidence as rookies to take over the music scene. ([We Are Bulletproof pt. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJQzQPf9JJc) was recorded by some of the members in the original lineup of BTS (Rap Monster, Suga, J-hope, i11even, Supreme Boi, Iron, and Kidoh), before it changed to the current lineup. They released a [version with the current members as well in 2015](https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/we-are-bulletproof-pt1-4-begins-ruff)). The second release in the school trilogy, N.O, criticized the school system itself, asking questions like \u201cwho made us into studying machines?\u201d and \u201cA good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?\u201d The final release of the trilogy, Boy in Luv, experimented with their original hip-hop sound by adding in elements of rock music, and followed the story of a bad boy who has trouble admitting his feelings about a girl he likes. The follow up single, Just One Day, showed a softer and brighter sound, and each member described what their ideal day would be.  \n\n BTS\u2019 next release, Dark&Wild, was their first full-length album. The first half of the album is supposed to follow the theme of \u201cDark\u201d, and the second half is supposed to follow the theme of \u201cWild\u201d. The singles from Dark&Wild continued to experiment by adding rock into their sound. The first single, Danger, is a warning from a bad boy to a girl who\u2019s trying to play games with his heart. The second single, War of Hormones, is a lighthearted song from the perspective of a teenage boy about liking girls. War of Hormones was inspired from their time in LA shooting their reality show, American Hustle Life, with girls from their music video.  \n\nThe Most Beautiful Moment in Life series comes from a Chinese metaphor, \u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef, which is supposed to express the most beautiful moment in one\u2019s life. The concept for the album overall was \u201cthe beauty and anxiety of youth\u201d. BTS\u2019 sound took a large shift from their original sound with the lead single from \u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef pt. 1, I Need U. I Need U was a more electronic and melodic song compared to previous releases. BTS won their first music show award for I Need U, at \u201cThe Show\u201d on May 5, 2015. BTS\u2019 follow up release, Dope, was an exciting song that blended pop and hip-hop with saxophone.  \n\nBTS\u2019 first original Japanese single, For You, was #1 on the Oricon chart for a week.  \n\nIt's also worth noting that BTS has a hand in writing almost every one of their songs. The rap line (Rap Monster, Suga, and J-hope) have always written their own lyrics. Suga has even composed the music for four of BTS' songs; Let Me Know, Tomorrow, Jump, and \ud765\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 (Fun Boys/Boys with Fun). On the album \u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef pt. 1, the vocal line (Jin, Jimin, V, and Jungkook) have also started to write their own lyrics.

Discography</h1>\n\n<h2>Sound Evolution</h2>\n\n<p>(wall of text inc., sorry)  </p>\n\n<p>Originally, BTS came out as a full-fledged hip-hop group with a \u201cbad boy\u201d image. Their school trilogy focused on the problems teens in school face, with No More Dream asking teens to think about what their dream for the future is, rather than going through life mindlessly following what their parents tell them to do. The follow-up single, We Are Bulletproof pt. 2, declared their confidence as rookies to take over the music scene. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJQzQPf9JJc\">We Are Bulletproof pt. 1</a> was recorded by some of the members in the original lineup of BTS (Rap Monster, Suga, J-hope, i11even, Supreme Boi, Iron, and Kidoh), before it changed to the current lineup. They released a <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/we-are-bulletproof-pt1-4-begins-ruff\">version with the current members as well in 2015</a>). The second release in the school trilogy, N.O, criticized the school system itself, asking questions like \u201cwho made us into studying machines?\u201d and \u201cA good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?\u201d The final release of the trilogy, Boy in Luv, experimented with their original hip-hop sound by adding in elements of rock music, and followed the story of a bad boy who has trouble admitting his feelings about a girl he likes. The follow up single, Just One Day, showed a softer and brighter sound, and each member described what their ideal day would be.  </p>\n\n<p>BTS\u2019 next release, Dark&amp;Wild, was their first full-length album. The first half of the album is supposed to follow the theme of \u201cDark\u201d, and the second half is supposed to follow the theme of \u201cWild\u201d. The singles from Dark&amp;Wild continued to experiment by adding rock into their sound. The first single, Danger, is a warning from a bad boy to a girl who\u2019s trying to play games with his heart. The second single, War of Hormones, is a lighthearted song from the perspective of a teenage boy about liking girls. War of Hormones was inspired from their time in LA shooting their reality show, American Hustle Life, with girls from their music video.  </p>\n\n<p>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life series comes from a Chinese metaphor, \u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef, which is supposed to express the most beautiful moment in one\u2019s life. The concept for the album overall was \u201cthe beauty and anxiety of youth\u201d. BTS\u2019 sound took a large shift from their original sound with the lead single from \u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef pt. 1, I Need U. I Need U was a more electronic and melodic song compared to previous releases. BTS won their first music show award for I Need U, at \u201cThe Show\u201d on May 5, 2015. BTS\u2019 follow up release, Dope, was an exciting song that blended pop and hip-hop with saxophone.  </p>\n\n<p>BTS\u2019 first original Japanese single, For You, was #1 on the Oricon chart for a week.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that BTS has a hand in writing almost every one of their songs. The rap line (Rap Monster, Suga, and J-hope) have always written their own lyrics. Suga has even composed the music for four of BTS&#39; songs; Let Me Know, Tomorrow, Jump, and \ud765\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 (Fun Boys/Boys with Fun). On the album \u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef pt. 1, the vocal line (Jin, Jimin, V, and Jungkook) have also started to write their own lyrics.
