In April of 2014 David Cohen, executive vice-president of Comcast Corporation, told The New York Times that Comcast does a [\u201cgreat job on way more than 99 percent\u201d]( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/business/media/comcasts-real-repairman.html?_r=0) of its service calls.\n\n\nOn DSL Reports, Karl Bode [promptly called Cohen and Roberts out] (http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Comcast-99-of-Customers-Love-Our-Customer-Service-128627) on their baffling claims, writing that \u201c[Comcast] tries to pretend that they simply have so many customers, it's a small vocal minority of complainers that are to blame for the company's bad reputation, not the company itself:\u201d\n\n\n**Comcast Math:**    \nI like math and I crunched some numbers using David Cohen\u2019s estimate that\n\u201cComcast does a great job on way more than 99% of service calls.\u201d  By Cohen\u2019s estimate, Comcast does a Not-great job on only 1% of service calls.  For simplicity\u2019s sake, I\u2019m going to refer to a Not-great service call as a \u201cComcast Fail\u201d.\n\n\nAccording to David Cohen\u2019s numbers:\n\n\nThe probability of a Comcast Fail is 1 in 100.\n\n\nThe probability of [three consecutive Comcast fails] (http://bgr.com/2014/09/24/why-is-comcast-so-bad-20/)\n is 1 in a million.\n\n\nThe probability of [six consecutive Comcast fails]( http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/comcast-incompetence-inspires-more-painful-tales-from-customers/) is 1 in a trillion.\n\n\nAnd the HOLY SH*T probability of my own Comcast experience \u2013 [25 consecutive Comcast fails](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) \u2013 is 1 in 100 quindecillion (a 1 followed by 50 zeroes).\n\n\n*To recap, according to Comcast executive David Cohen\u2019s publicly stated estimation, the odds that someone could ever have a Comcast experience like mine are 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000*\n\n\nHas anyone ever experienced Comcast screw up more than one time in a row?  Please do share.  And if you\u2019d like to crunch the numbers yourself, just calculate 100 to the power of N (where N is the number of consecutive Comcast fails).  For instance, if you\u2019ve been through 4 consecutive Comcast fails, 100 to the power of 4 equals 100,000,000 (therefore the probability of 4 consecutive fails is supposedly only 1 out of 100,000,000).\n\n\n**Mr. Cohen & Mr. Roberts, unless you are actively trying to insult or antagonize your customers, the media, or really anyone who hears you speak, you should probably try a tiny bit harder when making up completely bullshit statistics about Comcast service calls or customer satisfaction.**\n\n\nI like Math.  And I dislike your fictitious statistics.\n\n\n-- End of Part 4 of CCTA \u2013\n\n\n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 1: How Comcast Grinds You Down](http://redd.it/2mtxtf)*    \n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 2 - Comcast Fees & Collections: A disturbing practice]\n(http://redd.it/2my61d)*    \n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 3: Reddit\u2019s Magic Wand](http://redd.it/2n1ghx)*    \n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 5: The non-apology apology](http://redd.it/2ngyh2)*\n\n*Edit: Fixed a minor typo in one of my hyperlinks*",
