It's become so corporate that the customer experience and barista experience is extinct. Missed an add shot? Work harder. Missed a connection? Work harder. Drive thru times long? Work harder. Haven't reached your sales goal? Sell more- but make connections. Haven't had time to clean as it's been out the door all day? Work harder. Over labour? Cut. \n\nDay in and day out we give our heart and soul to this company, only to be told we haven't been doing good enough. If we express this to the higher ups, we're left guilty as we have all these great benefits to be thankful for. \n\nCustomer connections can be such a beautiful thing to see/hear but they're no longer genuine, rather forced. Our baristas have become emotionless zombies and they're all miserable and completely stressed. \n \nI genuinely hope that someone comes forward and changes things; because this company can't survive on numbers alone. All these great people you've hired? They have soul, and love. They're the people who will carry your company forward, stop taking advantage and help them do their jobs. \n\n\n/rant. ",
