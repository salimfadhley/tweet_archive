I know very little about this mutual fund and need some help. After doing some research I believe this is not a good place to have mutual funds, and I think the funds I am investing in may need some work.\n\nHere are the two funds:\nFranklin Founding Allocation Class A - 245 shares\nBlackrock Global Allocation Fund Inc Class A - 228 shares\n\nThis account has been active for almost 10 years now, but I am looking to switch to something like a Vanguard mutual fund and IRA combination.\n\nIs it worth pulling funds from this account to start another or will I pay unnecessary fees? Will I have to pay extra taxes to put it into another account? I am new to investing and need any help possible.\n\nThanks!",
