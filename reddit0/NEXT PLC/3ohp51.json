I managed to do this over 2 wars, with the country being split between myself and Novgorod.\n\nMy most recent run is now in the 1600s, but I have run into a massive wall, the PLC-Novogord, lockstep allies who take time off of doing nothing to kick my ass into the ground every ~20 years. How am I expected to deal with this?\n\n\nSome details:\n\n* Ottos didn't make it this game, they exploded into rebels and also eventually got onto the PLC hate-train, losing Constantinople eventually (I assume they should of been my best ally against Europe), Timmy also exploded, but I wanted and expected that.\n\n* PLC itself could field approximately 150k units by itself, with Novgorod contributing another 50k by the time I quit, far more than I could ever hope to field, and their armies were pretty on par with mine, despite my having 2 mil ideas to PLCs 1 and Novs 0 and tech parity.\n\n* I westernized in 1520, and my ideas were Admin -> Offensive -> Influence -> Defensive\n\nSo whats happening here? The one chance I got to screw with them was when they declared on me separately and I gave the PLC what they wanted and did my best to crush the very rich Novgorod. Are Muslim units worse in general than the EE ones? Will I have to try to fit a war against Poland in the early game in? Was this mega PLC just an abnormality, because it was damn terrifying to see right next to me.\n\nNew to playing with the Steppes and learning to adjust to a all war, all the time playstyle and its fun though.\n",
