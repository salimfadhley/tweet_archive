It&#39;s been a boring day, and I&#39;m finally about to get a good little mystery to solve.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Senior line, Bytewave. You may send me your ticket.&quot;<br/>\nTeleworking High Cannabis-lover (THC): &quot;Heeeyyy, mannn... Oh yeah the ticket.&quot; .... &quot;Here goes.&quot;  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of these days, the amount of people who are obviously teleworking stoned, with every call recorded, is going to cause a storm of fecal matter. I don&#39;t know who, when, how, but it will. Problem for another day, I&#39;m not the pothead police.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Alright, I&#39;m reading your customer says his modem had been resetting every couple days, and since he last called us it&#39;s almost every two minutes?&quot;<br/>\nTHC: &quot;Yeaah.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;When was this, there&#39;s no ticket but yours filed in the last 90 days?&quot;<br/>\nTHC: &quot;Uh. Today. I think.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;So somebody forgot to put the call in Remedy, always helpful. By any chance, he didn&#39;t talk to <em>you</em> earlier, did he?&quot;  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just trolling him a bit, but as I guessed he&#39;s too stoned to pick up on the joke. I run diagnostics and there&#39;s definitely something odd. There&#39;s a signal issue, single address, requires a service call, but it&#39;s the kind of problem that&#39;ll cause you 1% packet loss and a reset every couple days or so. Yet, that modem is resetting every two or three minutes. Nothing wrong with the cell, immediate neighbor with 200 days uptime. Now, we get modems resetting on a loop now and then because of software bugs, but that&#39;s just it, they reset -on a loop-, not every 2-3 minutes. I assign it a new IP address, wait a bit, it resets again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Well the obvious RF issue doesn&#39;t explain the reset frequency I&#39;m seeing these last 6 hours. Still obviously needed a service call, but there&#39;s clearly isn&#39;t one because there&#39;s no ticket.&quot;<br/>\nTHC: &quot;Um, the customer said a road tech was scheduled for Saturday AM.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Well, there&#39;s not, see for yourself. The other guy screwed up pretty bad if he confirmed it to the customer without putting it in and before getting a confirmation number.&quot;<br/>\nTHC: &quot;Sooo... I put in a service call for Saturday AM?&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Nope. That&#39;s what the other guy should have done before this started, but now there&#39;s an issue I don&#39;t understand yet. Think a S*****RoadTech Inc contractor will figure it out?&quot;<br/>\nTHC: &quot;Heh Heh, nope. The guy&#39;s already pissed as hell... best not gamble on those odds.&quot;   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I start digging in the modem&#39;s logs and notice something. The RF resets that modem had before were logged as a connection loss, which fits the issue, but the new ones are <em>software resets</em>. Something&#39;s wrong, that should only happen if we push a firmware update or reset it with our diag tools. Unfortunately no readily available logs for that on my end.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;You didn&#39;t send any resets to his modem yourself, right? Okay. How pissed did you say he was?&quot;<br/>\nTHC: &quot;Eh, the works I guess. Very? I just filter out the noise with these guys...&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Yeah. Tell your customer you&#39;ll call him back within 30 minutes, this may take a bit. Please hold.&quot;  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now I want the diag tools detailed logs. Just a hunch nagging at me as I dial...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Systems: &quot;Systems.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Hey, &#39;Systems&#39;, this is senior line, Bytewave. I need full diag tool logs on a modem.&quot;<br/>\nSystems: &quot;The full logs are sorted by user. Will need the login you want them for.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Nope, won&#39;t do. I need the other way around, has to be possible. MAC Echo Delta Zero One Foxtrot...&quot;<br/>\nSystems: &quot;Errr I&#39;m not sure how to do this without the login creds.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s harsh when you get a call and they don&#39;t just need a password reset... hah, just kidding! But I&#39;m sure you guys can figure it out and I need it, I&#39;ll hold.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And so we go on hold for awhile. I notice the angry customer&#39;s modem resetting again. Grab a large coffee. I look at the reset exact timestamps, increasingly suspecting there&#39;s only one logical explanation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Systems: &quot;Okay, turns out there&#39;s a way. Check your email, it&#39;s all there.&quot;<br/>\n<a href=\"/u/bytewave\">/u/bytewave</a>: &quot;Thanks, &#39;Systems&#39;. Have a good evening.&quot;  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I start at the bottom, and slowly, because these logs are full of garbage and don&#39;t seem to be meant for humans to read. I see what I did to it, that&#39;s a start, and then over a hundred times the same thing. Among the garbage the pattern becomes obvious. Software reset, and a user id: Trevor. Thankfully given what I&#39;m seeing, Trevor is a subcontractor, and a particularly bad one to boot going from memory. I look at the very first time he sent a reset to this modem, 12:15. Log in the call monitoring software, check his 12:04 call, first of his day, 1200-2000 shift. Listen to the call starting a couple minutes in. It&#39;s worse than I thought. It&#39;s not just the customer who&#39;s angry, it&#39;s textbook what-you-cant-do. Trevor is angrier than him and they&#39;re fighting on the phone and baiting each other, and he&#39;s cursing at the customer. Right after the call ends, the modem resets for the first time, and now we know for sure. <strong>He&#39;s been manually resetting the modem his entire shift just because he&#39;s pissed at the customer, and he&#39;s still doing it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay, Trevor, you dumbass, I may just be a union employee but you&#39;re not finishing that shift. Getting rid of s***** subcontractors is my guilty pleasure. </p>\n\n<p>To be continued.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/search?q=author%3ABytewave&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all\">All of Bytewave&#39;s Tales on TFTS!</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
