This is due to a concern that if they do not start strong then there will be a sell off as people try to jump on the new hype trains before they leave the station.

If he can perform like last season he is absolutely worth 9.5m but there is a severe risk with Tottenham&#39;s first four fixtures being MNU (A), STK (H), LEI (A), EVE (H) that he may not get going right out of the blocks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clyne (5.5m) (39.3%)</strong> - Newly transferred player in a team of new players that will likely lose their star player. Another big performer from last season with 142 points and so his high % makes sense currently due to his relatively reasonable price for a defender. However, I suspect there may be some growing pains in the first six fixtures as Liverpool travel away to Stoke, Arsenal, and Manchester United. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, but I feel like it&#39;s a concern that you should take into account when building your team heading into GW1.
