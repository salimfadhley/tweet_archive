Nike has beaten prediction **10/10** and has been sky rocketing. EPS and revenue are supposed to double within the next few years and there seem to be no REAL competitor in the world. However, I do feel the duty to let you know that a few analysts advise FootLocker instead of Nike, which doesn't really make sense to me. I rate this stock a **BUY**.
