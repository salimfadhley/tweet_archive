Recently, I have completed my bachelor&#39;s program in an IT field and have accepted an offer of employment with another company. Since I will be leaving PayPal, I will no longer be able to verify these eBay employees an thus, unwilling to assign appropriate employee badges.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, I ask of you to decide whether recognizing eBay employees should stand as it is, which would require assigning a current employee as a new mod for this purpose or, getting rid of it altogether.</p>\n\n<p>My last day is on December 13th, at which time I will remove my <a href=\"/PP\"></a> flair and make the appropriate changes/removal to the remaining employee flair based on the consensus here. Should a new mod be assigned, I will make a decision based on post history as I do not know the other employees personally.</p>\n\n<p>I know this may not seem like a big deal to most of you, but I feel that the employee redditors have been a great help and it deserves a bit of attention.</p>\n\n<p>Respectfully,</p>\n\n<p>Me</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit:</em> Ok. Some of you have voiced your opinion and it sounds mostly in favor of keeping the flair.
