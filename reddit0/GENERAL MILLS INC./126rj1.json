  "selftext": "Hello, 22 y/o student here.\n\nPlease, CA voters! Vote Yes on Prop 37. Prop 37 is a measure that would require products containing genetically modified foods to be labeled.\n\nMost food in the US contains genetically modified crops, due to the heavy saturation of cheap genetically modified soy and corn on the market. Not only do these crops have questionable genetics (some are bred to contain certain toxins in order to resist insects) and being sprayed with pesticides/chemicals that get passed on to the consumer, those same chemicals sink into the soil, and future crops are exposed. \n\nWith cancer and other serious health problems remaining relevant in our society, I think labeling genetically modified foods will not only allow us to be more selective of the things we eat, but it will prompt people who aren't aware of these GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) to learn more about their health and food safety. 30 years ago, you probably could walk up to most people and ask them what a vegetarian was, and they wouldn't have an answer. These days, almost everyone knows that a vegetarian is someone who doesn't eat meat. Additionally, there are many more vegetarian/vegan options in stores, along with growing health food stores that are becoming more prominent. Why is that? Because of a slowly building awareness to importance of diet in relation to health. These labels will continue the awareness, and hopefully will set an example for other states, and allow for an even healthier food selection and standard for future generations. \n\nEven if you're not voting, please tell your friends, parents, and use social networking to get the word out on prop 37! Monsanto, a large corporation that creates genetically modified crops in addition to creating the pesticides used on them, is dumping a LOT of money into the \"No on 37\" campaign. This is because voting yes would cut into their multi-billion-dollar business. That's why I wanted to create this thread, in hopes that the power of social networking is stronger than these big industry figures who only care about the health of their wallets.\n\nThank you for reading! Hopefully one day everyone will be able to exercise the right to know what's in their food! \n\nPledge: I'd appreciate any pledge to vote yes, tell a friend, post on a social network, upvote, or any combination of those! \n\n\nPlease read more information about prop 37 and GMOs here:\n\nhttp://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_37,_Mandatory_Labeling_of_Genetically_Engineered_Food_(2012)\n\nhttp://www.panna.org/blog/farmers-speak-out-ge-labeling\n\nhttp://www.carighttoknow.org/tags/yes_on_37\n\nhttp://www.panna.org/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis\n\nDonors against: \n\nI wanted to also reference the large amount of  big-name donors against this proposition.
