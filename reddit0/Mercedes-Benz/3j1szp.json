  "selftext": "I'm 16, and I'm looking to buy a car in the near future. Being 16 years old, I can't get a new car, but I have my heart set on a used Mercedes-Benz. I'm in the $15k range but that could increase with help from my parents. So far i've been looking at what I could get for that price and i've been eyeing a 2007-sh E class which seems like a good deal to me but what do I know, I'm 16 and i've never bought a car before. Anyway, thats not what this post is about, this post is to get tips from the Mercedes community on what would work, what wouldn't, what to look out for, what to expect and stuff like that. Any help is greatly appreciated! ",
