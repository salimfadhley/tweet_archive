  "selftext": "Sorry if wrong subreddit just wanted to share. \n\n\nMay 2, 2014\n\n\nThank you for contacting me about Federal Communications Commissions' (FCC) net neutrality regulation. I appreciate knowing your thoughts on this issue.\nAs you may know, on December 21, 2010, the FCC adopted an Open Internet Order, better known as \"net neutrality,\" that imposed new federal regulations on the types of services Internet providers could sell. Verizon Communications sued the FCC arguing that the regulations were too stringent and went beyond the agency's authority.\nOn January 14, 2014, in the case Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality regulation. The Court stated that the FCC did not have the statuary authority to compel a broadband provider to follow the Open Internet Order.\nI understand the concerns expressed by those who support net neutrality regulations; however, I also believe that such federal mandates would unduly inhibit this industry's innovation, investment in new technology, and job creation. Moreover, the Internet and online content have thrived in the United States without net neutrality regulations, which throws into question the need for more government intervention. Although there is currently no legislation before the Senate addressing net neutrality, please be assured that I will keep your thoughts on net neutrality in mind, should the Senate begin consideration of open internet legislation.\nThank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.\nSincerely,\n  \n\nPat Toomey\nU.S. Senator, Pennsylvania\n\nEdit: It should be know that I'm not really good at writing things. In fact one of the main reasons I emailed him was because anther redditor wrote a nice generic email to copy paste. \n",
