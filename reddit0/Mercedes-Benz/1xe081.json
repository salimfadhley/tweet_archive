He loved his car inside and out and was unhappy that the previous owner had none for it.\n\nNow this car was on a whole different level to the GT-R.  The black paint showed up every single swirl, every single deep scratch and every single paint chip - even without specialist lighting.  The paint was dull and lifeless, but was also very thin (measured 60-120 microns).\n\nThis meant that 100% paint correction could not be achieved without actually burning through the clear coat, so the utmost care was needed to perform safe correction with gentle polishes.\n\nUnfortunately due to time constraints, no planned photoshoots were performed :(\n\nHope you enjoy the album!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/IfrbL#0",
