I will say that yes, I am a Starbucks employee and I understand fact that Starbucks as a corporation tends to push mom and pop coffee shops out of areas. In this sense yes, I agree with the general mass. No bueno. \n\nOther than that, as a Starbucks employee once you get past the everyday douchefuckery that involves dealing with the general public and their general public needs, it's actually a decent place to work; definitely my least stressful job ever. Great benefits, equal opportunity hiring....generally speaking, Starbucks seems to do a decent job of trying to have a sense of community, at least in the area I work. The baristas I work with are all amazing; as a team we do our best to inform people about our coffee and as a whole I'd like to think we enjoy our jobs to some degree. I know there's a generalization about baristas being pretentious, but I thoroughly enjoy answering questions about drinks and coffee, and dont mind taking the time to help people.\n\nIt just seems to me that alot of the hate I hear coming from people is hivemind. Yeah, the people who come into Starbucks are generalized as being hipster douchefags, but how does this reflect on the company itself? I dont expect everyone to love our coffee, there are only a couple of blends I enjoy myself and I can get down with Caribou Coffee and Dunken Donuts as well as the Mom and Pops in the area.\n\nI dont know, Im just baffled guys. I'm not ashamed to say I love Starbucks, not only because they give me money but because I feel that as a company, they're pretty decent. Is there some underlying Starbucks corporate scandal I dont know about? Did I miss the Starbucks hate train?\n\n\nTL/DR: Why cant we just spread the coffee love?\n",
