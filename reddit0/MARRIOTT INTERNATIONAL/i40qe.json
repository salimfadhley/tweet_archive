After a 4 hour delay, they cancelled my flight from Richmond, VA to Boston, claiming that weather was the issue, and thus they were not responsible for reimbursing or accommodating passengers. I argued with them at the counter, since flights to the same locations on other airlines were still going out. They wouldn't budge, and I had to rebook and pay for my own hotel for the night. They then delayed my flight the next morning. A trip that should have taken 90 minutes ended up taking 20 hours. \n\n\nHelp me get the word out. The airline should reimburse customers for expenses and lost time.\n\n**TL;DR** US Airways claimed that they were delaying flights for weather during the recent computer outtage, so that they wouldn't have to pay customers.
