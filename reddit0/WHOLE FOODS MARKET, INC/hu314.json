  "selftext": "This will be a long post, but I\u2019ll leave a tl;dr near the end. This is interestingly my first reddit post ever, and I am rarely one to share such personal details of my life with the internet, but I knew that this story will be of great interest to many of the readers and posters of this subreddit. It\u2019s the story of how an orthodox liberal Democrat, one who followed the party line on basically every important issue, naturally became a very sincere Libertarian, and why I think that history is indisputably on the side of Libertarianism. My thinking in posting is this -- demographically speaking, this subreddit is likely populated with people who are college age, in urban or suburban neighborhoods who can afford internet connections and leisure time to read. In other words, many of you probably know quite a few Democrats, and my hope with this post is for the reader to engender some empathy toward them, and explain how you might move their conscience toward better beliefs. This post will mainly be biographical, but I think we can all glean some lessons on how we might more effectively change the minds of those around us.\n\nSo, first things first, my entire family is made up of liberal Democrats. My father told me when I was growing up, \u201cSon, your grandfather used to always tell me \u2018if you care about the little guy, you\u2019ll always vote for Democrats\u2019\u201d. This visceral sentiment always made sense to me, when I was a kid watching Bill Clinton talk about the plight of the poor, when I was a teenager watching the Bush tax cuts get passed, when I watched Republican senators defend lowering taxes for the most prosperous corporations in the world. It was simple to me, Democrats are for the poor, Republicans are for the rich. I also despised the way the religious Right imposed their values on people who chose to live a different lifestyle. Tolerance, as I figured, was a virtue of the Democratic party.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stop there either. I eventually became a fairly un-religious person (and still am), and this led to a reasonable amount of distaste for the culture of conservative Christians, and the bigotry they tended to express. I was a happy culture warrior.\n\nWhen I watched Barack Obama\u2019s speech for John Kerry in 2004, I cried in joy (don\u2019t throw up yet, I watched it again for fun a month ago and could easily make out the contours of a tyrant)\n\nI was so hopeful in 2008, that finally we had a politician who would stand up for our freedoms, for our civil liberties, end these insane wars, and save our middle class from the big bad corporations.\n\nAnd then he actually took office.\n\nThe last three years have slowly taught me the nature and evils of our two party system. I know I don\u2019t need to rehash to this audience the ways Obama is just as shitty as Bush (Patriot Act, explosion of debt, war), but seeing that for me has finally shown me the nature of American politics.\n\nCould lead to a lot of pessimism.\n\nBut recently I\u2019ve started putting things together, and have realized just how much history is on the side of free-market capitalism, the empowerment of increasingly larger segments of society, and the general libertarian worldview. So now I\u2019m going to sum up what I believe is the single greatest driver in the world of individual emancipation from tyrannical elites, whether socialist or corporatist.\n\nIt\u2019s technology. Specifically the internet. Only technology has the power to fundamentally rewrite the rules of society, and technology wants a free world.\n\n**Let\u2019s face it, because of technology (and it\u2019s component creator, capitalism) we have:**\n\n\n-Smartphones that can record police lawlessness\n\n\n-The means to organize a credible political campaign around a Texan congressman who is loathe to the American oligarchy\n\n\n-Information that is as free as air (Wikipedia et al)\n\n\n-The means to expose and combat the worst abuses of the elite (Anonymous, Wikileaks)\n\n\n-New signs of an encrypted currency (Bitcoin) that can nullify states\u2019 ability to tax and and peer into the economies of free individuals\n\n\nIt may be tough sometimes to belong to a political group most dismiss as \u2018fringe\u2019, but the trend is clear. American politics and the two party system as we know it are approaching their end, and technology will one day empower us to fully emancipate ourselves from the tyranny we currently tolerate.\n\nThis has become so long, I think I\u2019ll stop there and do my tl;dr then maybe give some ideas of how to share your ideas with liberal Democrats.\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n\n-Culture war divides non-elites along trivial lines preventing things like war, erosion of civil liberties, and debt from being effectively opposed\n\n\n-It\u2019s possible and natural for liberals to become libertarians\n\n\n-Technology is the libertarian movement\u2019s greatest hope, and it\u2019s a great hope to bet on. The future is going to fucking kick ass!\n\n\nNow for some general thoughts from my own experience, on how to talk to liberal Democrats. I only became a libertarian in the last year so the memory is fresh. To be frank, I think libertarians could do a MUCH better job communicating their ideas, especially since they happen to be correct.\n\n**Here we go:**\n\n\n-Be nice! For Christ sake we\u2019re all human and want the world to be a better place, so be empathetic. You\u2019ll convince more people that way. You can truly and deeply understand a person\u2019s worldview without agreeing with it, and doing this will empower you to more effectively nudge them in the right direction.\n\n\n-Don\u2019t engage in culture war. It\u2019s divisive in all the wrong ways.\n\n\n-Emphasize that there is a difference between corporatism and capitalism. I used to think that Monsanto was an exemplary example of capitalism. I know now it\u2019s the result of a government/corporation mafia that has regulated out the competition, the disruptive startups, and all the rest.\n\n\n-Show how kind and good capitalism can be for the world. If speaking to an effete Starbucks drinking, Prius driving liberal from the Bay area, for example, point out that capitalism is what gave them organic apples, grass-fed beef, hybrid cars, and all the rest. Government gave us corn subsidies and the agro-approved food pyramid (if you study nutrition, you'll know it probably kills an unconscionable number of people every year). If the whole world watched Food Inc. and government was out of the picture, the horror of commercial agriculture would be seriously disrupted by the market.\n\n\n-Emphasize the intellectual consistency of libertarianism, as compared to the back and forth opportunism and blatant lying engendered by partisanship. Libertarians are ALWAYS going to be anti-war, pro civil liberties. Many liberals will be also. Our two party system creates monstrosities like Harry Reid defending the Patriot Act after trumpeting his opposition to it just years prior.\n\n\n-Emphasize how peaceful trade promotes peaceful coexistence. Economic integration promotes non-violence.\n\nK sorry I know it\u2019s so long, but I thought this would add to the discourse in this subreddit. Thanks for reading! And what do you guys think? How do you think we can be better ambassadors of our viewpoint?",
